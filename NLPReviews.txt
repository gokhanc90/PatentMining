R1:	5/35/18 update Don’t waste your money. These products are NOT made to last. The Robovac 11c replacement (3rd replacement) quit working properly. The vacuum now gives a false error as if there is something stuck. I spent $200 on a vacuum that lasted a year! We had a great initial experience with this product, but it was short lived. Unfortunately the warranty from the original purchase expired 60 days ago. I am now stuck with another Eufy Robovac that does not work, and all I get from customer support is 15% discount for another product that will not last. DON’T BUY IT!!!!! Update… Eufy customer support contacted me after my last review where I commented on the issues I was having after 3 months of continuous use. Once again, I have nothing but praises about their support. They offered another replacement, except this time with an 11c model. So far it works great, as did the first two. I hope this model lasts longer. I purchased this in march and was very pleased with it. The robovac does an excellent job navigating through our lower floor while we are asleep. It works quietly and we woke up to a clean floor. I am now on my second RoboVac thanks to Eufy's excellent customer service and running into the same problems I had with my original purchase. The vacuum does an excellent job avoiding walls and large objects, not so much when it comes to chair legs. After 3 months of ocasional bumping into chairs, the lens that covers the sensor gets scratched and becomes cloudy. Now I wake up to the sound of the robovac ramming into walls instead of avoiding them, just like my original did as well. I've tried cleaning the plastic lens but only works momentarily. Now it's also starting to have problems docking into the charging station, which I presume is due to the cloudy lens cover. It's sad that such a good product fails because o a small lens cover. Some small tweaks in design should fix this problem and allow the vacuum to work properly for longer than 3 months. Hey Eufy! How about placing a better rubber on the bumper to protect the lens cover, or changing the material ? If not for that this vac would have had a 5 star

R2:	UPDATE 1 on 07/31/17 Added a picture of my low-to-medium carpet. Also, the 4/3 beep has not come back yet. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have been using iRobot for many years. Bought this Eufy Robovac 11 when it was on sale and initially like it very much since it is quieter and clean well for my living room with hardwood floor. I have the robot programmed for every day sessions. The Eufy does not work well for other rooms with carpet, though. The biggest problem was with the 4-beep fatal syndrome: Just after 5 weeks, suddenly the robot stopped working with 4-beep and 3-beep. I did all steps as detailed in the manual to no avail. Since Amazon only allows returning for 4 weeks, I decided to investigate a bit further. It turns out that both the main brush and a side brush got stuck even after I cleared all obstacles. So, I took the stuck brushes out, spray some WD-40 lithium grease into the wells. Put the brushes back and rocked the brushes back and forth to pass the sticking point. The robot is working again and continue to work after more than a week ( will see how long will it work). In conclusion, the problems come from the gearbox of the brush - when it got stuck, it cannot reset itself. Even though I decided to keep this Eufy robot, I bought the iRobot 650 - a time proven machine that will work for all rooms (my current iRobot 5XX has been working for >5 years but I need a programmable one).

R3:	Very displeased. It bounces around the room as if it is completely lost, using 90 degree angles whenever it hits a wall. It gets stuck under everything, our couch, inside the maze our dining room chairs make, under the couch again, on carpet runners, bath mats, cords... you name it. I found that we had to "eufy"-proof our house as if we were introducing a new child to a home. Couch pillows scattered around the couch so that it won't try to get underneath, pick up any USB cords, put down a 2x4 bumper wall around our dining room set, prop open the door to our laundry room that it always manages to close itself into, etc. The list goes on and on. Maybe this is par for the course with all robotic vacuums, and if that's the case, I say save yourself the trouble. EDIT: I must thoroughly applaud Eufy/Anker Customer Service. They discovered this review and despite my purchasing this product months ago went far above and beyond. They quickly worked to thoroughly understand the problems I had with my Eufy, going so far as to ask for a video of the problems and engaging a product engineer. Sadly nothing could be done about my specific problems, but Eufy surprised me again by offering a full refund, including providing me with a free item of my choosing for the trouble. I have no hesitation in buying another Eufy/Anker product because of their exceptional Customer Service, despite the issues I had with this one particular product.

R4:	I purchased this having read reviews stating the RoboVac 11 gets stuck and rarely makes it back to its dock. In my old apartment, I had little problems and absolutely loved this unit. No, it didn't make it back to its dock every day, but 9/10 it would run for its 2-2.5 hour long battery life and did a great job with the pet hair. At this point, I would have rated this 5 stars for its price, ability to get pet hair, and how well of a job it did. We have since moved, and our house has air vents in the floor. RoboVac 11 does not do air vents. AT ALL. Or the ledge to a step. It senses a 'fall' when it gets near an air vent or a step, and just doesn't know what to do; it doesn't back up from the step ledge, doesn't avoid or go around the air vent, it just stops and beeps and will not try to resume itself later. RoboVac 11 rarely runs for longer than 10 minutes now, before getting stuck on a air vent.

R5:	UPDATE AGAIN: I loved my Eufy the fist 3 months. Had an issue with something and Eufy replaced the vacuum. Six months later I started having error codes, but was preparing to deploy so waited till I returned. Upon my return, my 12 month warranty ran out by 10 days. They sent me a new charging station, but that did not help. Now 1 month after that, the battery is apparently dead. No replacement. No help from Eufy. I also bought a EUFY for my brother, who after 9 months had similar issues and just threw it away. Great vacuum for a year, but not after that. I also own a RUMBA. It is way louder, but even after spending an unfortunate night outside in the rain, it continues to clean every day! I have had it 5 years! NO issues, except the couple of days after it's escape from the house. Spend the money on the Ruma. UPDATE: It has been a year and my brother and I have had issues. There is a 12 month warranty on these units. My first issue was resolved with customer support replacing my Eufy. Recently my Eufy has been beeping 4 times while charging. This happens at random times, usually around 2 am when I am trying to sleep. Apparently my brother had the same issue and he just stopped using his all together. I have changed the filter, roller, and brushes. I have let the battery die then charged it fully. Nothing helped. After doing all I know to do I contacted Eufy one week after my 12 month warranty was up. Guess what....yep....no help. Other than the annoying random beeping at odd hours, the vacuum is still working fine. I guess since both of our vacuums started having random error codes within 8 months of purchase, that must mean there is an issue with most of them. Or we are the most unlucky people ever. I purchased two of these. One as a gift and one for myself. I am a huge Rumba fan, but this had so many reviews about how quiet it was so I decided to try it. Plus you couldn't beat the price! My brother has a 2 year old, and is a super technology freak. He was skeptical at first, but after a week, he loves it. He was impressed by how much this little guy picked up. It is quiet enough to run when the baby is sleeping. My brother runs his daily and has carpet and a dog. Finally a gift for my super picky brother that he loves. The one I purchased for myself if SUPER quiet as well. It fits under my furniture better than the Rumba. I run mine daily and have a cat and a dog. After about 20 days I started getting an error. The nice thing is this unit tells you what the problem is, however, it doesn't shut up after beeping, it just keeps beeping. After extensive cleaning and brush removal, and trying to fix it, I was unable to clear the error. I notified Eufy. So far the customer service has been ok. I am still waiting to exchange it for a new one. If it fails within 30 days they replace it. It does come with a 12 month warranty. While I am having an issue with the Eufy, I highly recommend it. It is a true vacuum, unlike Rumba which is more like a broom. It is quieter, smarter, and has a few more options. Hopefully Eufy customer service gets on the ball or else I will change my review about them.

R6:	After 5 months of use I have become less enthusiastic about this vaccum. It's still a decent value, but there are quite a few cons about it. First the pros: I really sucks stuff up. Works especially well on hard wood floors. It's quiet. It's easy to maintain. Everything comes apart easily and intuitively. And you WILL need to maintain it to keep it functioning well. There's no point in having a programmable vacuum because all of the brushes and filters need to be completely cleaned out before or after every use. Now the cons: The big one and the reason for this review is the battery life seems to be significantly degrading. I have owned the vacuum for 5 months and run it every day on average. This morning the battery lasted about 1 hour. That is not long enough to do a very good job when the vacuum is as dumb as this one. And the brings me to the next con. There seems to be very little intelligence to the vacuum's programming. It will cover a small area over and over and over, until finally I notice and move it to another part of the house that needs vacuuming. It will get "lost" for long periods of time under furniture or tables, unable to find its way out. And the final con: the vacuum gets stuck. A lot. Depending on the obstacles in your house, you may have to rescue this vacuum a dozen times during 1 cleaning session. It gets stuck on things like: the underside of furniture and cabinets, floor vents, cords, etc. And sometimes it is stuck on nothing. You just have to press the button and it starts up again. But it's annoying that I can't turn it on and forget it. I have to keep checking to make sure it doesn't need to be rescued for one reason or another. Bottom line: It's a decent value and $200 for a robovac, but I'm very concerned about the degrading battery life. I will update the review to let you know how much worse it gets. EDIT: 11/20/17 The Eufy has become worthless. It stops every couple minutes and needs to be restarted manually. And this is on a light color clean hardwood floor. Time to contact customer service :( EDIT 2: 11/23/17 Eufy is working again after I found an object lodged in it. I have to say customer service is great. I think there is very little risk to trying this vacuum. As far as the battery life goes, customer service wanted me to test the battery life when manually plugged in, charged for at least 6 hours, and run on ONLY hard floors. Doing this the vacuum ran for about 2 hours. Which is fine, but unfortunately most of my house is covered in carpeting. When the vacuum runs on carpeting it only runs for slightly over an hour. Reading between the lines, this vacuum is really designed for hard floors and a few area rugs.

R7:	My wife and I work from home and live in a 3 dog household. We purchased this to save time, as without it, you would need to sweep 2-3 hours per day just to keep up with the fur and debris the dogs bring in from outside. The Eufy was great for the first few months, but then the problems started. I changed the filters regularly, and even bought a new rolling brush when the first one started falling apart after a few months. When I received the new roller it worked fine for a few weeks, now it continuously beeps 4 times with a solid red light *indicating rolling brush is stuck*...this is a new rolling brush, but hell I took it out cleaned it out, changed the filter and went about my day...the error continued to happen no matter how clean the brush was, and the robovac became unusable. I purchased this in May of last year, it made it to February, Eufy wants a video of the issue to be emailed to them to verify issue, then I ship it to them, then they ship me one back...all in all, you are talking weeks without the RoboVac I purchased to save us time, instead of going through this hassle (is the video really necessary being that I will be shipping you the defective item anyway and you could verify then??) I purchased a cheaper model by a different manufacturer, designed for pet households. My warning to pet owners is, if you are using this to get rid of large amounts of dog hair, the shelf life of this model is not worth the price. Very disappointed, and will not purchase Eufy again.

R8:	I was a big fan of this product--until it stopped working a few months ago. (It lasted all of 15 months.) I was getting the same 4 beep error, which indicates a stuck rolling brush. I diligently cleaned the robovac thoroughly, and watched numerous YouTube videos on how to clean and troubleshoot it. I even bought replacement parts to see if a new rolling brush would fix the problem. It did not. I recently contacted the manufacturer, and they were of no help. Because it stopped working after 1 year, it was not covered by warranty any longer. The company offered me a $30 credit to BUY A NEW ROBOVAC. And I guess just throw this one away..? You're welcome, environment! I searched for a local repair shop that might be willing to repair my robovac and I couldn't find a single one. I regret ever recommending this unit to my parents, who bought one, and my next door neighbor, who also bought one, because I know when those units fail (and I'm sure they will) they will wind up in landfill along with this one and many, many others.

	S15:	I regret ever recommending this unit to my parents, who bought one, and my next door neighbor, who also bought one, because I know when those units fail (and I'm sure they will) they will wind up in landfill along with this one and many, many others.

R9:	The vacuum worked great until it started spinning in a circle after about 18 months. Then I found out that if something is wrong with this product after the 12 month warranty expires, the company won't fix or replace it, nor do they have any replacement parts. I took it apart myself and figured out that one of the plastic gears in the wheel wore down and needed to be replaced. This part probably would cost about 5 cents if they had spares for sale. The only help they offered was a discount on a new vacuum (I think 10%). I ended up buy a spare wheel from another brand via eBay, hoping they had a similar gear. That cost $21, and I had to take one of the gears from that wheel and cut it down with a hacksaw. It was similar enough to work. So my vacuum is working again, but it cost me quite a bit of time for a minor issue. Beware before you buy from this company that after one year your product is trash if it has an even minor problem, assuming that you don't want to go through a similar hassle.

R10:	UPDATE: They Eufy no longer works! After a year it started spinning in circles and just continuesly beeps. It will run for 5 mins and then beep again in circles. I will try a different brand next time. This is my first RoboVac and it has far passed my expectations!! The cleaning capability of this thing is insane! I have 3 cats and 3 dogs with Hard Wood Floors and Tile through out the Down Stairs. I hit the Auto mode every morning before work and it runs for 1:20 mins. When I come home from work the Tile and Hardwood floors are spotless. With so many animals I was always sweeping and vacuuming before and now I don't need to. The Robot gets all corners and crevasses along with the middle and sides of the floors. Last night for fun I tested it upstairs on the carpet. I baby gated the stairs off and let it do its thing. Again, ran perfect and cleaned 100x better than my upright Vac. The one thing I will say is that when running on Carpet I dumped the tray a couple of times along with picking out my wife's and daughters hairs from the rollers. I don't see any way this could have been avoided as I used to do that also with my upright! I have run in both regular and Max mode and they both work great. Max mode has more suction so I tend to always run in that. The sound of this Vac is very quiet, you can deff run it while a baby is sleeping with out issues. So far I have had this Vac and week and don't know how I have ever lived without it. Thanks you Eufy RoboVac 11, you made my life so much easier. Don't hesitate to make this purchase!

R11:	Great! While it worked. Out of the box it was working great! it is truly a change from your day to day vacuum, but after a week it started to make a weird noise when pressed auto, it was like a double beep but no errors, Ok, just pressed Auto again and it was running with no issues. 1 Month later it started to show an error, "Side Brush is stuck" took them out cleaned them and working again, next day same error despite there was no object preventing the side brush to move, a week later the right side brush is no longer working, it does not show the error anymore it is just stuck and not moving at all. I have checked it over and over again looking for something making it stuck but nothing is in there. Im a big fan of Anker/Eufy products, I have 2 of their vertical mouse, screen protectors, battery packs, ipad holders etc.... but this product it's disappointing at least, less than 2 months working with very small usage ( it is an apartment of 785 sq ft with no carpets only laminated floor) Edit 08/15/2017: I contacted customer support which was extremely helpful, they issued me a refund and will be buying a new one once I'm back to the US. Giving the product 3 stars for its short life, customer support is definitely 5 stars.

R12:	Original rating was a one star. Customer service deserves 5 solid stars, they go above and beyond for their customers! Vacuum unfortunately is still more of a headache than its benefits. Customer service reached out to me promptly after my review and went ABOVE and beyond to make sure I was happy with my vacuum. I returned the original one, was sent a new one. That one had similar issues to the original. Getting stuck, not picking up everything, going around in circles, and not returning to its dock. Customer service asked me to send them videos and pictures of the vacuum so I did. They asked me to try a few at home tests to make sure the sensor was clear which it was (it was brand new) They then offered to send me an upgraded vacuum when the upgrade was done (mid December). I have been trying that new vacuum out, and have to say, it is more of a headache than anything. It gets caught under our couch, bed, side tables, and even our fridge. If the room is the slight bit dark the vacuum will run into everything! It is easier for me to just back to sweeping myself. Customer service is AMAZING!!! I wanted to love this vacuum but I don't :( I have had this for a month now. It has yet to go through a whole cycle without stopping, I make sure nothing is stuck, start it back up and 10 minutes later it is beeping at me. I have found it going in circles over and over again.

R13:	The Eufy RoboVac 11 does perform the basic function of sucking without manual intervention for brief interludes. However it seems incapable of navigating the most basic geographic features of a relatively typical single-floor apartment with hardwood floors and a couple of low-tuft area rugs. It gets stuck on the edge of rugs, under chairs, in corners, in wide open spaces, and, oddly, near shoes. The vacuum seems to follow a complex pattern in its cleaning process which leaves large swathes of the apartment untouched while smaller sections have started to develop tracks. The “return to base” feature has never worked, with the robovac beeping out its deep angst about its desire to tunnel through walls and furniture to return to its charging station while possessing none of the boring or ballistic capabilities that would be required to fulfill its mission. My 3 year old has named the device “Fred” and walks around complaining to anyone who will listen that “Fred is sooooo annoying”. I admit at times my wife and I will vent in obscenity laden tirades at the incessant error noises Fred emits and though I have noticed no discernible change in the machine’s performance following such outbursts, I sometimes detect a hint of moral superiority in its beeping. In short, if you are seeking an insecure, underperforming robot vacuum requiring near-constant supervision I highly recommend the Eufy RoboVac 11.

R14:	We loved our Eufy (affectionately named "Ollie" for some un-rememberable reason...) for a year and some change. He was our little workhorse; the dog furminator; the sucker of dust; and the occasional iPhone charging cord eater. But, about a month or so after the warranty ran out, our beloved Ollie started glitching out every time we used him. 4 beeps on a solid red light (rolling brush stuck indicator warning) both during operation and while sitting on the charging port. I cleaned that sucker out; replaced the spinners; lubed up his innards; tried everything to no avail. Finally, I contacted customer support. To their credit, they are polite and responsive, but they won't offer anything but 15% off a replacement unit or a replacement rolling brush, which they tell me won't fix the problem. This leads me to believe (and reading other reviews) that this is a recurring and well-known problem at the company. I hope that the company will do the right thing and replace the unit altogether, or offer a more substantial discount off a higher quality unit. I'd be happy to update the review to a higher level, because, when it works, this is a fantastic piece of gear. But, given the suspiciously inconvenient timing of its premature demise, I can't give anything but a 1-star until it's made right.

R15:	My wife thought I had lost my mind when I purchased this now she loves it. We have 2 greyhounds and it is nice to have the floors vacuumed each night as it keeps the hair, sand and dust cleaned up. We have dark vinyl plank flooring that shows dirt so this is nice. This is our first robot vacuum and it has been a pretty good experience so far. As one reviewer opined that it acts like a "drunken frisbee" for the first while then seems to get more efficient. I still think it tends to wander a lot and after 3 months of almost daily use it seems to be running into walls more. I carefully cleaned the front lens and it seemed to help some but for a while the vacuum sounded like it was trying to break into our bedroom at night. Visions of a robot apocalypse come to mind... My review is a 3 not 5 because I am concerned about the longevity of the unit if it keeps loosing it's way and it bashing into walls every time it runs. At some point that is likely to cause some failures. Time will tell. Update July 19, 2018 We are up to just over 13 months with this vacuum. We use it almost every night and only when we are away it doesn't run. That means that it has cleaned our floors well over 300 times since we received it. That's at least 5 times a week and we haven't had any other problems other than what is noted above. It still runs into everything but keeps on working. Many reviewers have seen a failure after 12 months or so with only weekly or slightly more frequent cleaning so I am not sure why ours is still going. I would like to get at least a couple years out of this...hopefully.

R16:	At first I loved my eufy, but suddenly it started turning circles after a few months and I could not get it to work properly. I emailed the company and they did not respond. I bought another one and now this one has stopped working after a month. Waiting for a response. I bought one for my cousin and was going to get one for my daughter, but now I just want them to take everything back. I am heartily disappointed.

R17:	UPDATE: Dont waste your money on this one unless you have a small, empty room that needs vacuuming. It doesn't do a complete job and the unit is constantly getting stuck somewhere. You're better off paying a cleaning service or put the money towards a Neato or Roomba. PROS. Does a good job picking up dog hair. My husband has serious allergies and we have a Lab that is in the process of shedding. It's as though she's on a payroll somewhere and is paid per eah time i have to sweep up fur which i did several times a day! When I set the vacuum to start running my husband was constantly clearing his thrpat and coughing. The longer the vacuum ran that less he coughed until he stopped completely. It senses things in its way and avoid it. Our old Neato was on a seek and destroy mission. It would roll over any and everything. This also doesnt fall down the stairs. CONS: I had to get up and rescue it from places where it got stuck. By that I mean it went underneath a rocking chair and kept going back and forth between the two rocker thingies instead of getting out. It wanted to go that way ---> and was going to continue trying until it gave up. It stopped and started beeping which is how i knew it had an issue. I know it has sensors because it would approach things and then back away except there. Another thing is that it continued to vacuum the same areas over and over. The Neato we had used its laser to pick up haair and dust. When Neato couldnt detect anything else (i would see it turning to try to sense things) it would return to based. I couldnt figure out the rhyme or reason behind the Eufy's cleaning method. it wanted to clean our foyer over and over until i guess the battery went dead.I BOTTOM LINE: i cant see setting the timer and leaving it to work unsupervised. Ideally I would set it to start running prior to us getting home from work. I can see now that I would be pissed because the thing got itself penned in somewhere and didnt do anything all day. I have to rescue it several tiimes each time it runs but I'm pleased with its performance other than that. I would buy this again. it does a very good job removing the dog hair and it's so quiet that it can run without drowning out the tv.

R18:	so far so good, but because it is so good at avoiding things and not ramming things, I can't get it to go through my dining table chair legs to clean under the table. Roomba is very loud and hit things, but it cleaned under my table well. Eufy is very quiet compared to Roomba. I'd probably get a Roomba again versus Eufy if I were to do it all over, but this is ok for the price so I'll just stick with it. Update: after getting a replacement, the new one still won't go under stuff that has lots of overhead clearance. Watching it is very frustrating, as it seems to be headed in the right direction towards a bunch of dirt and then just changes direction for no reason. Short of using the remote to make it go where it needs to, which defeats the whole purpose, I won't get a complete cleaning. Wanted to like it soooo bad because it's so quiet, and lots of great reviews, but I'm going to have to return it and get another loud roomba. Update: increased to 3 stars due to AMAZING customer support.

R19:	I recently purchased the Eufy Robovac 11 on Amazon during Prime day. It was a great price, especially compared to the competitors, and I was really looking forward to using it. I bought a Roomba 650 about two months prior, and after reading reviews on the Eufy Robovac 11, I decided I would give the Roomba to my best friend who just bought her first home, since the Eufy seemed to have better suction and was overall a better vacuum. I had to withdraw my offer to my friend, since I ended up keeping my Roomba 650. Some of the major areas where I think the Eufy fell short, compared to my Roomba 650: - Eufy does not get to all corners of the room (hardwood floors). Instead, it stops about 6-8 inches away and turns. My floors are darker brown, but I read reviews where people say they had dark or black floors and it worked without any issue. - Eufy does not have as good of suction as the Roomba 650. There were many times where the dust bin was completely clean and it would roll over lint or dust, and would not pick it up. I tried troubleshooting the device, and was not able to figure out anything that would successfully make it pick up all dust in it's path, during one pass (and I am talking about a FEW dog hairs, and maybe some lint from my wool rug that have migrated over to the hardwoods). - The patterns in which it travels across my floor is not smart. I don't expect it to be actually "smart" because I know it's not a smart vac, but it would often keep going in circles after bumping into something, and would take a few laps to get out of that cycle. It just wasn't very efficient. - Half of the time, it would very gently bump something. The other half of the time, it would slam into railings, furniture, etc. - It really struggles on carpet. It is much slower, and it has become stuck on my rug as well. - It does not make it back to the charger all of the time. - The brushes and/or fan on the vac seemed to fling dust the opposite way sometimes - Brushes could be more heavy duty. My Roomba (bought used!) brushes are stronger and don't look like they have had near as much wear in two months of regular use, compared to the Eufy, which was tested about two or three times at most. The benefits of Eufy Robovac 11, compared to the used Roomba 650 that I previously bought two months ago: - The Eufy is SO QUIET! My roomba is incredibly loud, and I LOVE HOW QUIET THE EUFY IS! - It is seriously so quiet, that I am so amazed that it's possible to be a robot vacuum. I just wish it had more power and suction. - it is QUIET - MAN IS IT QUIET! - Battery life is great - Design is beautiful and clean - I did not use the remote, but I like that it came with one. Again, I really, REALLY wanted to love the Eufy, and hope they make a better robot vacuum in the future. :) Each time that I have run the Eufy, I have had to turn the Roomba on after the Eufy finishes to pick up everything the Eufy left behind. This resulted in me only using the Roomba. In summary, if suction worked better, and if it sucked up a little bit of dog hair/lint in one pass, I would have kept it. MAYBE mine is defective... no clue. I really wish this would have worked out!!!

R20:	Works well, but I would not recommend letting it run when there is no one around to check on it. It has a habit of getting stuck under the bed or running over the leaves of plants and then beeping for assistance. That said, I'll get up on Saturdays, turn it on, and let it run loose while I'm doing chores around the house. I maintain it doesn't like to be alone, because it always seems to be whirring about in whichever room I happen to be working in (not a complaint, just an observation). We have not had any issues with how it cleans, only that it will occasionally get stuck under the bed (it's a low frame on the bed). UPDATE: In the middle of 2018, "Jeffrey" as my husband dubbed it, started to launch on his own. About 3:00 in the afternoon, he'd start out about the house. That was fine on the weekends, but during the week, he'd get stuck. So it became a game after work to come home and find Jeffrey. We had a few power failures and suddenly Jeffery was starting out about 2:00am. We'd be awakened either by his cries for help or his banging into the closet in our bedroom. I carefully went over the instructions and set him up to start at noon every day. He never automatically went out again. Worse, whenever I'd start him to go, he'd immediately return to the home base. I ordered new parts (filters, brushes, etc.), cleaned him well, reset him, and tried again. He was fine for a week and then got progressively worse. At times he'd spin for a bit in the same spot, move about three feet, and then head home. It was as if he had Alzheimer's. He couldn't remember what he was supposed to do, where he was supposed to go, and where he had just been. We had a simple ceremony at the garbage can on a cool winter Saturday. RIP Jeffrey.

R21:	He worked okay at the vacuum-ing part, but he gets stuck on EVERYTHING. The divider between hard wood and tile floors? Stuck. Kitchen mat? Stuck. Tile around the fireplace? Stuck. Kitchen cabinet overhang? Stuck. I "baby proofed" my house really well for him (no wires, curtains, etc) and he still got stuck within 20 minutes of beginning operations every time. I used him pretty sporadically when the dogs dragged a lot of stuff in from outside, grass debris etc, and he was okay at taking care of that. I never had him set on a schedule because he got stuck too much, so I used him maybe once a month or a little more. After 12.5 months (right after warranty expired) he died. He will make a beeping sound when I attempt to turn him on and then his light flashes like he needs to be charged I guess. I bought the SquareTrade warranty for him as well but they're feigning ignorance about my purchase (despite being shown the transaction) and won't do anything about it. So while I WOULD recommend the extended warranty, the extended warranty is also apparently a waste of money as well.

R23:	This product is horrible. It has extremely small container for the debris that is picked up and must be "cleaned" after every use or it will not clean at all. But WAIT! it's worse! This robot has NO IDEA of where it's been. It will wander endlessly and never cover the entire area. It will bounce around the room and never completely cover the floor. It gets tangled, it gets stuck on many floor situations and gets stuck under furniture and can't find it's way out. Furthermore; if you keep it more than 30 days, there is NO RETURN and NO REMEDY from Eufy. I feel like I wasted my money on this poorly designed contraption. And in those moments when it does any cleaning, don't expect it to be clean like you are use to when you use a powerful vacuum cleaner. We've had this for about 90 days and are greatly disappointed.

R24:	There were a lot of concerning aspects about this unit right out of the box but for the relatively low price I would say they were manageable. The unit gets stuck on EVERYTHING, the lip of my fridge, lips of couches, slight inclines, rugs etc. Eventually I was able to determine all of the spots it would get stuck and put up barriers which is of course a huge hassle. The next issue out of the box is that it has very poor coverage. The areas it does go over get cleaned well but it seems to go over and over the same areas while neglecting large swaths. The above issues put the unit in the 2-3 star range for me but now after 4 months the unit no longer works. I get solid red light 4 beeps error for a stuck rotating brush a minute into cleaning. This occurs even if the rotating brush is removed from the unit. I have now seen multiple people reporting the same issue and it is clear they don't have a solution. Customer service is making me jump through hoops to try and troubleshoot the problem but the issue is widespread enough now that it should either have a known resolution or not.

R25:	When I first purchased item, worked great was very happy with product. Raved about it to my co-workers. Now it only runs for approximately two minutes and stops. I replaced the battery and still no help. I e-mailed customer service and because warranty expired was offered a $30.00 discount if I purchased another one or EUFY would repair it for $80.00 because the warranty expired. I have had this a little over one year and would expect the robot to have a loner life. I bought this based on a very positive recommendation from the "Everyday Cheapskate" a nationally syndicated consumer affairs columnist. I will be contacting her about the robot and poor response from EUFY customer service. I just bought another Robot of a different brand. I will never buy another EUFY product and give their product and the customer service response one-star! which is too high in my opinion. I have heard their customer service was top-notch, not my experience

R26:	We got a Eufy and loved it until it broke after 3-4 months. It was doing the circles of death (goes in circles and then beeps 4 times and stops). They sent us a new one after we sent them a video. Same thing happened. They send us a different model that was larger and more clunky and the front bumper of it broke, based on its symptoms, not sure how it broke with regular use. I would never get a Eufy again. It was quiet, but the last one they sent us wasn’t as nice or quiet. Looking for a replacement as it was a huge time saver for 2 large hairy dogs and kids when it did work for those 3 months. Wish it would have lasted. Looking into other brands.

R27:	Updated review... this link on Youtube fixed my problem, my sensor was dirty and the battery contacts were dirty, added 1 star back on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQngc5YG0I Eufy is basically identical to iLife V5, the ball sensor needs to be pulled and the little led hole cleaned of fuzz, charging contacts were dirty too... Battery is nearly dead after 3 months. It stops in the middle of a room after running for only 10 minutes after a full 24 hour charge. Constantly gets trapped and hung up on table legs and floor vents. I regret that I bought it and I actually bought one as a Christmas gift too... It has a weird highly repetitive search pattern that it runs and goes back over the same places several times but misses >50% of the floor when it does work. Not even a robot a very stupid random search pattern at best.

R28:	I've had this little gem for several months and it's been wonderful with some glaring issues Pros -It works well on hardwood floors. -Very low profile and it can clean under the bed and ottoman without any issues -It's not very loud -It can clean at least two rooms with a single charge Cons -Has trouble with shag carpet (I know, i know there aren't too many but our living room has large portion of it covered by the shag carpet and only adequate location available for the charging station was in the living room which it has navigating on its own around the carpet. I would typically pick it up and move it to the bedrooms to start the cleaning process with the door closed) -It still bumps into things occasionally. I was under the impression that it will get very close to objects and rotate but it does still bump into things like door stops, furniture legs -Cleaning algorithm takes very long time to clean a single room. It does seem to be very through but it is all over the place in terms of cleaning and it does seem to cover most of the area. However this in turn takes very long time to complete say a larger room like master bedroom with more furniture than say a second bedroom with daybed and a desk. -Occasionally i see it having trouble with parking itself on the battery station properly and i would find it not charged up.

There is plenty of room there to maneuver itself around several times over but it does seem to struggle a bit there -Brush action sometimes pushes away harder dirt away from the vacuum
	S1:	I've had this little gem for several months and it's been wonderful with some glaring issues Pros -It works well on hardwood floors.

R29:	Well, it had a short but fairly nice life. Our RoboVac started going in circle after 2 1/2 years of fairly light use. We ran it no more than a couple of hours a week. After I totally cleaned it and it still did not work, I called Anker Customer Support. Let me state that I have multiple Anker products and am happy with them all. This time, I was advised that the problem was the wheels and they are not fixable or replaceable. Therefore RoboVac was dead. Since the warranty was only 1 year my only option was to purchase a new one and they would give me 15% off the FULL retail price of one on Amazon. Really! The life expectancy of a vacuum should be more than 2.5 years. Sorry, I will not be purchasing another RoboVac. Aside from being able to get under my bed, this is just a lazy person's expensive vacuum. Don't waste your money. Just get a regular vacuum that will last for many years. Until these hold up a lot longer, I cannot recommend this product

R30:	When I first got this I was so excited and it literally changed my life as I was able to check one thing off my list of chores. I raved about it to everyone I knew. Now a year later and the Eufy RoboVac DOES NOT WORK! I’m one of those OCD people who cleaned my robot vacuum every time after I ran it. I even ordered additional side brushes and filters to change out frequently. I purchased this at the end of April 2017 and it stopped working in June 2018. I contacted Eufy support and they told me it’s outside of a year so there’s nothing they can do. They provided me with troubleshooting steps that you can easily read online or in the manual. Those suggestions didn’t work and now I’m out $350+ for only a years worth of using. Keep in mind that we’re a small family - two adults and a dog. We live in a one bedroom with all hardwood or hard surfaces and one rug. I cleaned this vacuum regularly and changed out the filters and brushes when needed. There’s no reason this product should’ve stopped working, unless it’s not a well made machine. I highly recommend AGAINST purchasing this product. Don’t waste your money. Research another brand... I’m sure there’s a ton of other brands that work better, have better support and are less than $350+.

R31:	UPDATE-2: These are crap. The brushes tangle on short dog hair constantly, it will leave clumps of fur about even after emptying, and it gets stuck on EVERYTHING! Now it keeps telling me my bumper is stuck but it isn't. This has been a huge waste of time and money, and I would love a refund. Eufy sent me a Lumos smart bulb as a "We're Sorry" prize but even that has started to flicker and not turn on. Eufy doesn't have quality products and I regret giving them my trust. UPDATE-1: Eufy has exchanged my unit and all is well again. No more squeaks! One thing I noticed after watching my Eufy Robovac clean, is that if you have a lot of sunlight on the floor from a sliding glass door, make sure you close the blinds. The IR from the sunlight overpowers the Eufy's drop/cliff sensors and it will avoid the area. Basically, it's scared of sunlight. After communicating this to support they said it will be reviewed for future product updates and that the current model wouldn't be resolved with a replacement so I'm keeping 1 star off. Otherwise, I'm happy with my purchase. I had a Roomba 600 series before this and it was twice the price. I am generally impressed with how well the Eufy unit cleans. Only issue after a few months of use would be it has started squeaking intermittently and we don't know where it is coming from. I cleaned the roller ball and the two rubbery wheels pretty good but squeaky squeak it goes around corners and such. Not a huge issue, we just set it to clean when nobody is home rather than overnight.

R33:	After going through 3 of these units, I gave up. After just a week or 2 of use, the first unit stopped vacuuming and sounded a 4 beep sequence for maintenance. I followed the instructions in the manual, but could not clear the error. So I called tech support for help and they also had me go through a few steps to clear the error to no avail. So, since I still had time left in my Amazon 30 day return window, I returned this unit for a 2nd unit. The second unit was lazy. After initiating the bot to clean, it would move away from the charging base 2 or 3 feet, do a circle and then go straight back home. I found that, it would go on and work if I would unplug the charging base so it could no longer find its way back home. But that took half the fun out of owning the robot since I had to manually return it home to charge after the battery went dead. Now that my 30 day window had expired on the original unit purchased from Amazon, I had to call Eufy customer service about the problem. Eufy's service was excellent! They were great about getting me a 3rd unit in a very timely fashion with a little headache as possible. But, the 3rd unit ended up having the same issue as the 2nd. Totally bummed out, I called Eufy customer service again. This time, they suggested I get a full refund and purchase their newer unit. I agreed. Then much to my dismay, I found the newer unit to be $80 more than what I paid. Naaaa.... why pay $299 when I can purchase an Ecovacs Deebot N79 for $199. I see it has great reviews too. I'm surprised the Eufy has great reviews with as much trouble as I've had.

R34:	This is a cute little robot that has a practical side. While it is still basically a fancy toy, it does pick up dust, hair, crumbs and like detritus from about 90 % of the floor. While nowhere near as thorough as a good vacuum cleaning, it will keep the dust down between vacuum sessions. It is fairly quiet and it goes underneath beds and cabinets (needs about 4" of clearance to easily get under there). However, it will get occasionally hung up on area rugs and does best on flat wood or tiled floors. It does not do a good job on corners, tight spaces or thick rugs. The dirt holding cup is small and needs to be emptied every time you run it, and sometimes it just dies when it runs out of charge, not making it back to its base. I thought it remembered the path it takes to not go over the same area repeatedly, but it just cuts a random path across the floor, over and over, until most of the easily accessible area has been covered. These are the first domestic robots and still need a lot of improvement to be effective. Don't expect it to eliminate the need for a real vacuum cleaner, or even to do light vacuuming flawlessly. However, if you have pet hair, or enjoy being on the cutting edge of domestic tech, then this little guy might be a worthwhile investment.

R35:	This vacuum is poorly designed from a functional perspective and is not worth any amount of money in my opinion. I bought this from seeing it advertised on CNET and thought it was a good deal considering the irobots can go as high as $1000 or more. It was a brand new unit and worked perfectly the first 3 times. The 4th time it began beeping error notifications. I didn't think much of it at the time and reset it and it functioned for a short while before beeping error notifications again. I had only owned it about a month at this point and just put it in the closet with the intent on investigating it further another time. Well some time had passed and before I knew it, it had just passed the warranty expiration date. I had decided to have it diagnosed and possibly replaced but was out of warranty. Waiting too long to make a warranty claim was my fault I admit, and though I tried to get a free replacement, I ultimately had to pay to get a replacement. I will say that the customer service representative I worked with "Sebrina" throughout the process was very helpful and understanding. She eventually offered me a refurbished model at about half what I paid for the new one and I did buy it. One day after initially charging it up and putting it to work, it began exhibiting the same issues as the new one. I contacted Sebrina and she arranged to send me a different one, this time a refurbished Robovac 11s and it worked for about 2 uses and failed as well. This is vacuum #3. I contacted her again and provided video to show the malfunctioning vacuums as I had done previously. She was quite perplexed and assured me she would do what she could to make it right. I ended up getting a new replacement at no cost about 2 months ago but have been reluctant to use it as I have not had a good experience with this product. My advice to those who buy this vacuum is to be aware of your remaining warranty period. They will not replace it if it is out of warranty. They do have some of the best customer service representatives I've ever had to deal with, so there is a bit of consolation there if you ever have to contact them.

R36:	I used this product very infrequently and it lasted about 2 years. I don't think this item used maybe 4x/ month should only last that about 2 years. It frequently would get stuck so I could never set a timer and leave it to vacuum w/o someone being home to monitor it. It did fine on hardwood but was not good at mapping. It tended to vacuum mostly in a small radius and I would often have to move it manually to direct it to another area of the hardwood. It is not for carpets but since this was my first robo type vacuum, I am not sure that any of them are. Not worth the money in my opinion. I will be trying a different brand.

R37:	It was ok. It did pick up dirt/dust/crumbs really good. The reason I returned mine was because it kept getting hung in random spots. Sometimes it would hang under the fridge, most of the time not. Also, at the time of me returning the robot there were no spare parts you could buy. I'm not sure if that's changed yet or not. I do see myself purchasing another Vacuum like this in the future, but I will more than likely spend the little extra and go for the name brand. Edit* 11/22/17 I will say that their customer service was pretty awesome. They reached out to me after I had returned the device and left this review and offered me a decent discount if i wanted to purchase another one and informed me that all the parts were in fact on Amazon now. Also, they offered me any anker or euffy product up to 40$ just for my troubles. You don't often see customer service like this anymore.

R38:	I have had this for less than a year and a good two months of that it was in storage. The vacuum will eat any cord it gets near which is incredibly frustrating. It gets stuck under the refrigerator which seems to be one of its favorite places to go. There is no rhyme or reason to its pattern and it skips entire sections of the room. It also doesn’t pick up everything, or even close to that. There is always a lot left behind which defeats the purpose of this vacuum. You also need to make sure there is nothing on your floors or the vacuum will knock it over or vacuum it up.

R39:	We bought this after a friend of ours only said good things about it. She also has 2 dogs and hasn't vacuumed in month (and her house in very clean), so we thought this little robot would be our new best friend. Wrong. This thing is for people with NOTHING on the floor, high furniture and round room corners; I have none of these. After 2 hours of randomly and inefficiently going around in my house, getting stuck under furniture and screaming for help, I only got to empty the "bag" twice, which is nothing for what needed to be picked up. The vacuum power isn't that great either, even in "blast" mode. It has a large footprint and avoids everything in its path. I tried every mode and understood the logic from A to Z but still couldn't get it to do a satisfactory job. I sent it back, too bad.

The first time it was replaced under the limited warranty and the second time it had gone out of warranty. It was for the same problem both times, just kept spinning in circles. When I spoke with the claims rep, they said that they don’t offer repair services and to just “throw it away”. I have learned my lesson not sticking with a familiar name brand. I can’t believe I wasted my money on this product. It’s very shameful that they won’t even repair it. I’m not asking for a free handout I just wanted to pay to get it fixed.

R41:	Initial quality was great - really enjoyed it during the first year of its life. However, one month out of warranty and... it died. Solid red light and four beeps. Followed troubleshooting steps, replaced all brushes. I searched online and found that this is a common issue. If you find links to their forums on this topic, you'll notice that everyone is directed to email their support team. So, I emailed support. I sent them video and all of my details per their request. They offered to give me a $15 credit if I were to buy another Eufy product. Anker (Eufy's parent) clearly know this is a flawed product not designed for long-term use. I will buy a Roomba to replace it.

R42:	Our replacement died just as the original did. Only it took longer. We had a three beep error code pop up on our first unit. Reached out to customer support and they replaced the unit. Fast forward about sixteen months and a four beep error occurred. Both motor related. It’s only used on hardwood floors and we run it every 3-4 days. Contacted customer support. The first line rep replied with a no help answer. Asked to escalate and received response from a manager. Update: The manager sympathized with our problem and offered a small discount on any new Robovac or purchase an older refurb model for a discount. I highly appreciated the courtesy versus the first line response of you’re SOL. Anker came through in the end, which is quite the opposite these days. I commend them on their customer support in the second round.

R43:	I’ve had to replace this vacuum three times. Each time it seems to work for a few months and then something or another causes it to malfunction. I’m particular about keeping my tech and belongings in good shape and following whatever instructions come with it, but despite frequently cleaning it and such, it simply kept having issues. To be clear though, it still works, but it will give random error beeps and stop in the middle of a cleaning cycle despite the unit being clean and the area being obstruction free. For all the unit's issues, the customer support at Eufy is absolutely phenomenal

R44:	So far after a few weeks of use I can say this product is not bad. That being said, it's also not all that it could be. 1. The bristles are strong but will deform if the robot get caught somewhere for more than 5 minutes. 2. It will trap itself on mats itself climbs over. It also somehow likes to traberse my metal threshold to the back door and caught it trapped on my concrete porch 4x. This is a HUGE reason why I chose 3 stars. 3. Batter life is nice, noise is nominal, capacity and filter are normal & adequate. 4.can get trapped in rooms easily even with open door. Timer mode seems to be hard to use. 5. Seems to have hard time remembering chosen setting IE, edge, max, spot clean, normal. All in all, I am going to return it because the fact that it traps itself on my kitchen and bathroom mats are very annoying. Other than that, this is pretty nice!

R45:	I gave this vacuum 6 month of use before a review. Live in a home with open floor plan, all hard wood and tile flooring with one low pile rug. Frankly, this vacuum has been a major disappointment. Clean pattern is poor, missed lots of spots even when run for full battery life. Sensors are poor, stop randomly in mid room and changes direction like it senses something but other times will hit wall several times before changing direction. Battery life is ok but it takes 30-45 minutes at it slow seeking battery housing speed to find the charges, even when in the same room. I would say 1/2 the time I find it somewhere completely dead as it never made it back/found the charger. The brush gets even small fibers stuck in it very easily. Suction seems average at best and machine is pretty loud when running. Remote is easy to use and set-up. I have purchased another brand now about 1 month ago. Name brand and its WAY better across the board. Recommend you pass on this vacuum.

R46:	This is our first robot vacuum and we've had mixed results. While the vacuum does a decent job of making the vacuuming the home easier, more often than not, it gets stuck or need intervention. Perhaps, the newer model has addressed the shortcomings of the model I purchased, but here are some limitations with the model we've used for several months. -Difficulty going over raised mats. In our kitchen, we have foam mats on the floor and this vacuum has trouble going over it, often getting stuck and letting out beeps to let me know that it's stuck. Sometimes, it doesn't get stuck, so it's hard to know when it'll and when it won't. -Difficulty clearing under some furniture. Sometimes, the vacuum will get stuck underneath a dresser while other times, it'll go under just fine. When it does get stuck, it's at an angle that suggests some part of the vacuum is raised that causes it to get stuck. -Not being able to find its way home. The area around the charger has to be very clear or the vacuum often takes a detour and gets to the charger in a longer path or doesn't find its way to the charger at all. -Bumping into chair legs. Large objects are easier for this vacuum to avoid contact, but for chair legs, it'll often run into it and then change course. The bumper thankfully has a damper so that the impact doesn't impart too much force, but I don't recommend using this around expensive furniture where scuffs and scratches are undesirable. -Can't purchase another charging base. Amazon doesn't seem to sell the charging base by itself to help with using this on multiple locations. All in all, a good first effort by Eufy. I'm guessing the second gen and after has addressed some of these shortfalls?

R47:	ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love this vacuum it does a great job of cleaning, however, it is constantly getting stuck and it will go in the same spot over and over and neglect other parts of the room. If you have a large open space that doesn't have a lot of things like chairs in it (it gets stuck under our couch and entertainment center every single day) then this is a great budget vacuum robot for you. We have even tried to block the sections of our living room where it gets stuck but it knocks those things down by bumping into it and then gets stuck anyways. It would be best to run it when someone is home to make sure that it doesn't get stuck. UPDATE: BEWARE, within less than a year the battery died and vacuum broke down -- customer service sent me a replacement of the same model and it too broke down within the same time frame as the first vacuum. Customer service told me that the warranty only covered the original purchased vacuum and not the replacement so I spent way too much money on two vacuums that have a shorter lifespan than the $80 vacuum I bought at Walmart. I loved having this machine running while I am away for those "in between" sweeps but they died out on me so quickly that it is not worth the price. Plus, it is only adults in my house and we treated this machine well, kept up on maintenance, and made sure it didn't get stuck for it to still die out in less than a year. Save your money and spend a little more for a brand model and it will probably last you a lot longer than this one will and it will be less of a pain constantly checking on it.

R48:	I want to test this out for some times before writing a review. The robotic vacuum cleaner came with an extra set of brushes and filter which is great. I was using it in one section of the room at the time. When I tried to set timer so that it can auto clean, it didn't work. I tried it again, it came on at the totally different time than what was set. I have a German Shepard and she sheds like crazy. The robot need to be emptied out probably after 30 minutes or it will drag the hair with it. There are also areas where it will miss so I am thinking the function for mapping out the room doesn't work. I can't return this anymore so I will keep using it, but probably won't rely on the timer nor the mapping function.

R49:	Update July 2019: Bumper sensor failed again in the either repaired or refurbished replacement. Will be sending a strongly worded note to the company after I post this update. My parents Roomba 690 has held up much better and they're currently on sale for prime day. Spend the extra $ and get something that won't breakdown within a year. Update Jan 2019: sent it in. Not sure if they fixed mine or just sent me a refurbished replacement. We'll see how long this one lasts. Still mad that I had to spend money to fix it after only having it for a little over a year, but I'm happy to have it working again. When it does work, it vacuums nicely. If you own one and notice it gets stuck more often or is running into things, I would send it in. Looking back, I realize those two issues were a symptom of the bumper sensors starting to fail. They completely failed about 4 months after the first sign of a problem. Aside from the bumper sensor issue, I do really like the vacuum. We run it everyday, moving it from room to room because it gets stuck on door jams where our floors change from wood to tile. We empty it after every run because we have a very furry household. I take it apart regularly to clean the brushes and give it a wipedown. Comparing Roomba 690 and Eufy RoboVac 11: We bought our parents a roomba 690 for xmas 2017. They use it at our family's cabin to cut down on dust and the dreaded black fly massacre that happens every week (they love the warm metal building and die by the hundreds). They like it because they can turn it on via their phones on Friday mornings before they head up there for the weekend, which can't be done with the Eufy model. It is taller than the Eufy so it doesn't fit under some pieces of furniture. The cabin floor is concrete and the Roomba has no problem picking up the hummingbird sized flies. We've also put the Roomba up in the loft, which has builder's grade carpet, and it does a great job. I would say that both vacuums clean equally well, although, I haven't compared them side to side. Dec 2018: I took the thing apart and it still stops every few minutes. I'm on the hook for a $200 vacuum that doesn't work unless I want to spend another $80 (not including shipping) in order to fix it. It's not a product made to last. Will save up and purchase a vacuum with a longer warranty with a company that stands behind its products.

R51:	Initially I was happy with the product, but I’ve been having a problem with my Eufy—the alert to indicate the side brush is stuck, keeps coming on. I’ve taken it apart, cleaned it thoroughly and the problem is still happening. When I called the customer service number, the representative said I could pay $80 dollars to have it fixed, or opt for a discount on a new unit. This is not acceptable to me. I have not had the unit for very long and it doesn’t get that much use. To pay $80 to fix such a small part, at a cost that’s nearly 1/2 of what I paid seems unreasonable. And to opt for a new unit when the first one I bought has not performed satisfactorily, is again not acceptable to me. Why would I buy another unit just for it to break again? I’m happy to fix it myself, but it seems that the only options offered to customers are geared towards putting more money on the pocket of the company rather than standing by its products and making its customers happy with the product they’ve already paid good money for.

R52:	We bought this since we have 2 labs that shed. We used it twice per week and the automatic schedule was great but it didn't last one year. The roller brush started to not turn and the unit would run maybe 5 minutes and stop and beep 4 times. I reached out to customer service to see if it was something that I could fix myself. I watched you tube vid's and seen others have had the same issue. I cleaned the brush, motors and all inside the unit and still wouldn't work longer than 5 minutes. I contacted customer service again and they asked me to send them a video of it running and when it stops. They said it couldn't be fixed and i would have to pay for repair as it was out of warranty. I could maybe see that with running it everyday but we only ran it twice a week so this unit did not last. I have replaced with BG600 made by Bagotte. Buyer Beware. READ online reviews and lots of people have problems with this unit. I would suggest getting something else.....

R53:	I originally bought this vacuum in 2017 and was pretty happy with it. It had a really hard time getting back to its docking station but it cleaned well. Unfortunately, the motor died right about a year after we started using it. We were just inside the warranty period and it was really easy to get it replaced. We got the replacement, and again it cleaned well and we were pretty happy with it. But about 6 months in, the motor died on this one too! I called customer service and they said that the warranty is only good from the initial purchase date, not from the date of getting a replacement, so we didn’t have any options. Even though Eufy is a good bit cheaper than Roomba, it’s still a lot of money for a vacuum that lasts less than a year! And I disagree with their idea of not having a warranty on the new vacuum that they gave me as a replacement for the first one that died.

R54:	I had it for a little more than a year and it started acting up. It would beep 4 times and the light would stay solid red, indicating a jammed brush. I tiok the brush out and ran it and the result was teh same 4 beeps and solid red light. I emailed for support in April and did not get a response. I finally called support in June and spoke to someone and was told based on my description, I could send it in for $80 repair but there was nothing more I coudl do as it was out of warranty. While it worked, it was great, however I expect something like this to work longer and not have to invest $200+ every 18 mo, hardley worth it.

R56:	For the most part, I've enjoyed this RoboVac. It does a wonderful job cleaning - but my 3 star review comes from it getting stuck on quite a multitude of things. It would be much nicer if it was a little more agile in getting itself out of situations. Some examples include: Basically every register on the carpet. To be fair, this vacuum is meant more specifically for hard surfaces than carpet - but it gets stuck on every single register we have on the carpet. I've resorted to sitting them all sideways in the floor so that it bumps into it instead of running it over. The feet of my Lazyboy chair. It jumps up on them and gets itself stuck. The flashing between the hardwood and the carpet. There's about a 3/8 inch jump up, and while it's trying to round the corner of the doorjamb and go up it at the same time it gets stuck. Behind all of the plants. We've got potted plants in the house near windows, and the vac will get stuck trying to turn the corner between the pot and the wall. We've tried moving the plants slightly closer or further away, but no luck. Between the feet of the bed and the wall. Same story as the flowerpots. It does do a good job of sensing steps or drop-offs and stopping, but that's all it does. It runs next to it and stops and starts beeping at you. I suppose this is nice, but it's not quite what I had expected. I was thinking it would back away and continue in the opposite direction. Instead it just stops dangerously close to the edge. (Be warned if you're a pet owner and your pet loves to follow the vac around. Our pup almost knocked it over the edge!) Sorry for the novel review - but I wanted to share my full experience. Hope this helps your shopping! Best, Cody Ritter

I contacted their customer service and was given instructions on how to reboot the unit and it worked for Approx 3’more weeks. I contacted them again and asked for A new unit or a refund. They will no longer reply to me. AT ALL. In short this machine is cheaply built and does NOT last. Read some other reviews and you will see my review is NOT the only one like this. The positive reviews you read are NEW buyers and buyers should BEWARE when considering buying this product.

R58:	Does not work with rugs at all. Unless you don't mind the constant beeping over and over, you are better off just vacuuming yourself. I wanted to wait and see if it would get any better over rugs. Unfortunately not. I've had this for 60 days and it's paperweight. Bought an Oreck vacuum and it actually vacuums and removes particles off of rugs and floors. Really wanted to give this auto vacuum a try and it has failed miserably. This is good for days that you have cleaned and swept and you use this for very light use. Suction is extremely poor, instead of collecting small debris, it spins the debris out of it's way.

R59:	After a year of use I started to get the dreaded "four beep" error. After trying every fix I could think of, it dawned on me that it might be the battery. I found a replacement battery (not Eufy OEM) here on Amazon, that solved the beeps and got my Eufy running again. Yay! Long term review: handy, but not super-powerful. It doesn't get into corners as efficiently as it should. It works best if you cordon it off into a room and let it work alone for 15 minutes. For the price it's a good value; certainly better than having to vacuum yourself, that's for sure.

R60:	So this thing seemed really cool it had line planning object detection good suction OK reviews etc so i decided to take the leap and buy it. now i should say i bought a used one for maybe 20 dollars cheaper. it was my first rumba style robotic vacuum and i was rather excited. after getting it out of the box i read the manual found the mode i wanted and set it on the ground to go. first thing i noticed this thing did no planning whatsoever. it seemed to wander around aimlessly often redoing a spot 3 or 4 times and never making it to the next room. but it seemed to be picking up debris and i said hey whatever maybe that's just the way it works and i set up its little home base in the kitchen programmed it to run and went to bed. i was awoken by this little guy not a foot from its platform beeping and unable to move correctly. at some point the right motor had stopped working completely rendering the vacuum virtually useless. i will be returning this product soon. the motor issue could've been from the previous owner but that doesn't change the issue of just plain poor programming.

R61:	This item is great for the first few months, but once the plastic bumper on the Eufy gets scratched, the device will continue to beep prompting you that the "bumber is stuck." This will now be my second Eufy. I contacted customer service for the first Eufy that was malfunctioning and it did take them a while to respond, but they did send me a replacement Eufy. This second time, it has now been over a month and I have yet to hear back from customer service. It's unfortunate that such a good product is made of a material that continues to make the product unusable. I have seen multiple reviews with the same issue. I would like to stick with the Eufy brand but until they fix the bumper issue, I will be going with a different company and repurchasing a new robot cleaner. Eufy Company- fix that issue and your reviews will go up and it won't be a waste of money for your customers.

R62:	I loved this little vacuum I bought a year ago. Perfect for my small apartment! It was working fantastic until suddenly it started beeping like it was stuck out of nowhere. As you can see in the video, I have all wood floors and no carpet, I even put my furniture up to make sure it can give the whole floor a good cleaning, and yet it seems to stop with nothing around. I thought it may be a battery issue (not making it back to its base in time), but it will stop after just 10 minutes and only start when I physically push the button on top. I cannot figure out what is wromf with it, nor can I find replacement parts online. I was hoping to get at least a few years out of it, but sadly not. So just be aware that for such a great deal, this product didn’t seem to last.

R63:	The unit worked great at 1st, but then started getting 'confused'. It would seem sometimes the sensors get messed up and give incorrect data to the operating system. I contacted Eufy the 1st time to let them know and the agent advised to bump the sensor car a few times to get anything out of the sensor area. I did and the vacuum worked great again for a few days, but then began having the same issue. I contacted Eufy again and let them know and so they offered to give me a full refund and paid for my shipping to send to unit back to them. I also talked to the agent (Kevin was GREAT) and he suggested their new model. I'll be purchasing that one to replace the original, I've been very happy with the interactions I've gotten from Eufy with this situation.

R64:	Bought the Eufy RoboVac 11 in Aug 2017, half the price $100 less than the current price and almost 2yrs to the month it no longer works. When it was working it was decent for light vacuuming/picking up dust and light dirt from bare floors weekly or more in between regular vacuuming. But almost 2 years to the month it began with a red flashing indicator and 4 beeps. The label on the bottom of the device indicates "RoboVac's power level is too low." How this has happened with it always on it's charging base I'd love to know. That "long-lasting" 14.8v lithium-ion battery they tout, 5.82v is where it sits even after charging it directly plugged into the wall, bypassing the charging base. So much for long-lasting, when I have laptops/smartphones/etc. with lithium-ion batteries that last upwards of 3-5 years and still function. Have submitted a support request to Eufy to see if they will back up their "All quality-related defects on items sold directly by eufy are covered by an extensive warranty." Not getting my hopes up and in the meantime, I'll start looking for a real Roomba.

R65:	update November 2018 ... not so good anymore it is not as powerful as it was and the run time is getting shorter and shorter. all of this sounds like a battery issue to me. I would not recommend and I would not buy again. I have purchased 2 other robotic vacs as gifts and the recipients of those vacs love them and they are still going strong. 1 is one year old and one is 2+ years old. buyer beware of this one. so far soooo good. I got this on a lightning deal for $150. I've only had for a couple of days but it has run flawlessly for those few days. i received 2 spare brushes and 1 spare filter. if it keeps doing what it is doing, i will be completely satisfied. it has gotten stuck a few times but justifiably so. it does go back to the charger when charge runs out. i have nothing to compare to but so far soooo good.

R66:	I bought this because it was the budget option with good reviews. But I totally regret it. When we just bought working ok but it gets stuck EVERYWHERE and sometime even without reason. Just stops. We have a table with six chairs I had to put the chairs up before every cleaning. If you have stairs you’ll need to block them since it will start beeping every time it reaches de corner. And don’t even think about turning on before you are leaving the house, you’ll be back and you’ll be 15 minutes trying to figure out where this thing is and you’ll find it throw somewhere without having done even a third of the cleaning. Now after one year and a half after dealing with this horrible robot it stopped working without reason. It vacuums in circles and then starts beeping. Just do yourself a favor pay a few more bucks and buy the original one.

R67:	Purchased in 2017. Ran it every other day. Quiet and picked up dog hair. Today one of the side brushes stopped working so the whole thing won't work. Looked all over internet, doesn't seem to be any fixes out there. Not sure what life expectancy of these robovacs should be but we expected to get more than 2 years out of it.

R68:	I bought this to maintain the 1st floor between real cleanings with a proper vacuum. I am starting to think it was a waste of money. Disclaimer - this is a household with pets. Our regular vacuum is a Bissell Pet Hair Eraser, and dog hairs DO NOT get tangled on the brush. This RoboVac, unfortunately, has a plain old rotating brush and bristles, and dog hair gets caught in it - a lot. Every 2-3 run times, you'll notice that the tray is either empty or close to empty, and that is a sign that the brush needs to be removed, pair of scissors brought out, and you need to have a go at the brush and remove all the hair that gets stuck on it. After using the Bissell vacuum with the no-tangle brush, this is a real PITA. I think I could get over it if it did other things I bought it for well, but it doesn't. Scheduling - I tried twice, and it scheduled only for the next run - didn't have any luck running it on a daily schedule. In all honesty, it would not make a difference anyway, because... Navigating - it get stuck all the time, in the same spots. We have hardwood and tile, with a 4x6ft low-pile shag rug. It can get on the rug, but it gets stuck on the edges of it all the time. It gets stuck when it goes under the sofa and tries to go on the rug. It gets stuck under the front of the fridge.It gets stuck around the bottom of the dishwasher. It "humps" my end table for as long as you let it - table base is low and circular with one tube going up from the middle of it, and Goofy keeps humping and going in the circle around it seemingly forever. Yes, we named it Goofy because the name of the manufacturer looks like Gufy instead of Eufy, and because it gets stuck constantly. I bought this to help between regular cleanings, to schedule it and have the house clean when I get home, but it requires so much user interaction, it makes it useless. So, hair get stuck in the bristles, I can't schedule it and it gets stuck all the time. On top of this, going over my rug after "Goofy" has completed its run with our Bissell produces so much hair, I'm not sure why I even bother. I think this would be great for household without pets, and for floors with single level surface only - no rugs or anything raised. But it doesn't work well at all for our needs. I should have returned it while the return window was open..

R69:	I purchased this vacuum in June of 2017. It worked great and did as advertised. However, in October of 2017 it stopped working. After working with Eufy's support they determined it was defective and sent a replacement unit. I was extremely pleased with the support I had received. I had even recommended a friend to purchase one, which he did. Then in April of 2018 the vacuum started making a loud grinding noise. The noise would disappear when removing the main brush, and a replacement brush did not resolve the issue. I reached back out to support, and once again they sent me a replacement. Slightly annoying that I've had to replace it twice, but at least support was helpful and sent us a replacement. Just over 3 months later the 3rd Robovac we've had failed again. Now it states the main brush is stuck, when it turns no problem manually. At this point Eufy support came back and said they will not be sending any more replacements as it is outside of the warranty. This was infuriating, as we never had a working Robovac for more than 5 months. This product is garbage, and while their support was helpful at first, I can no longer say anything positive about them. Not taking care of a customer that has had multiple defective products is borderline unethical. I will never purchase nor recommend another Eufy product. UPDATE - Support has reached out to notify us that they will now replace our latest defective vacuum, so I have updated my review from a 1 to 3 star. Hopefully this one lasts.

R70:	Very ineffective. I have stained concrete floors and cowhide area rugs. It will not go over the cowhide and gets stuck. If just keeps running and trying to go over the cowhide. It really surprised me that it would not be more effective, I really thought it being low nap it would work. However, it won't even go on the throw rugs in the kitchen. It is permanently housed in the corner of the dining room. I would NEVER recommend it. Unfortunately, you only have a 30 day opportunity to return it and if you have anything happen during that time that will not allow you to try it out you are screwed, the company makes no exceptions.

R71:	it does a good job of picking up dog hair. My entire home is hardwood floor so that is probably ideal. I can’t speak for carpet. I have also made it easy by picking up all unnecessary things on the floor except furniture. If you have a lot of tight spaces it may struggle. My favorite thing about it is when it goes under the bed and gets all the dust and hair. I used to have to bend over on hands and knees with a swifter. However I can’t say it’s the last time you will need to clean you floors. They should have incorporated the little brush in a recess of the container that holds the debris. That way it does not get lost. You need it to clean the dust from the bin. I’m happy with it.

Now this one, which started out fine, has resorted to slamming in to everything that comes in its path at full speed or getting stuck on or under pretty much every piece of furniture I own every five minutes. I hate this thing, honestly, it's just easier to use the old upright hoover we have.

R73:	I bought this product upon the strong reviews from others who bought this via Amazon. Unfortunately the first Eufy did not function properly, hitting all walls hard as if the sensor was not working, scratching up baseboards, etc. I contacted the company, sent a video confirming the errant behavior, and they agreed it was in need of replacement and sent a new one. To my dismay, the second Eufy had the same issue. So I posted a one star review on Amazon. The company immediately contacted me and sent me a third Eufy, and it appears the third time is a charm. The third Eufy works beautifully in the house, bumping up against some obstacles but mostly gentle nudges as it vacuums up dog hair and crumbs like a pro. I still can't gve it three stars since it appears that there are a lot of defects in production, but I have bumped my review up from 1 star to 3 stars to reflect the fact that the vacuum, after six months of back and forth, is finally functional as promised.

R74:	The jury is still out on this item. As a cleaning unit, I'm more than pleased because if I don't empty the canister after it's done cleaning each day, it won't have the room to hold the next day's dirt. Very pleasantly surprised. On the downside, it tended to clean the same area of the house over and over instead of moving throughout the whole house, and it doesn't always find it's way back to the docking station. It also gets stuck in tight corners, so I don't like to have it run automatically when I'm not at home, or it will start beeping when it's stuck and drive my dogs nuts!! That being said, I've returned the item because I'm wondering if maybe this particular unit is malfunctioning so that it doesn't cover the whole house. I like its cleaning functions well enough that I'm going to purchase another one a give it a go to see if it moves around the house better than the first one.

R75:	It cleans just Fine, but it seriously is the most annoying thing ever. It get stuck every 5 seconds. I’ll get it unstuck from whatever it’s gotten lodged under, turning it so it’s not directed right at the thing and boom, it turns and gets suck under the same damn thing I just pulled it out from. You can’t just have it set to go while you’re gone cause how often it gets stuck. I figured the bumper on the front would stop it but it wedges itself in there damn good. It doesn’t go strait down a hall or next to a wall either it keeps trying to turn and just keeps bumping into the walls. I regret Blowing my money on this product, spend the extra bucks and get the Roomba

R76:	This was our first robot vacuum and we loved it at first. It does and OK job on our hardwood floors but you will still have to manually vacuum every once in a while. We had to find creative ways to block it off in certain areas because it does not have any type of boundaries. It has a problem picking up larger objects like dog food, rice or larger crumbs. It knocks the larger objects out of the way with the brushes instead of pushing it to the middle where it is picked up. Our true problems started just after the 1 year warranty expired. Our side brush stopped working. We tried cleaning the motor and brush assembly, we even tried removing the brush but it never worked reliably after that. Then the motor suddenly wouldn't ever stop even when it was on the dock charging, we had to turn the unit off to stop the motor. Now the motor doesn't work at all. Customer support was no help, they do not offer a replacement motor. They just wanted me to buy an entire new vacuum. I'll find a better way to spend my money next time.

R77:	Ordered this product just over a year ago, and was amazed at it's initial performance. After the first month I noticed that it needed to be rescued more and more often. Most of the time it was under a couch, chair or table. Fast forward to about the 6 month mark, and it is all but useless on carpet. The vac now only spins in circles and goes into distress mode whenever it touches carpet. Move it back to the hardwood floor and it works like a dream again. This vac does a great job around the edges of a room if you have hardwood flooring, but if you have any carpet or area rugs be prepared to hear it's incessant beeping. Replacement brushes and filters are east to find, and are relatively inexpensive. If you have only hard wood, or tile floors this vac will do a pretty good job. The battery life is pretty impressive, but it has never found it's way "Home" to recharge. In hindsight not a great purchase.

R78:	The roller brush motor on this vacuum began failing about 14 months after purchase so it was out of warranty. After going through all the trouble shooting(cleaning hair out of roller brush bearings, running without roller brush and getting the same error code), I contacted eufy support about getting a replacement motor or out of warranty service. They flatly refused. So now I have an otherwise perfectly good vacuum with a bad motor that I am unable to repair. Motor replacement would be a simple procedure. I have had the vacuum apart multiple times to clean the motor. If you buy a Eufy product, just know that it is disposable. There are no replacement parts. If it breaks out of warranty, your only option is to throw it away. I really wish that I had bought a Roomba. It would have been more expensive initially, but I would have been able to get replacement parts. There is a reason these things are so cheap. You get what you pay for.

R79:	Updated Review: Originally I gave this vacuum 4 stars (down from 5...), but I have now changed it to 1 star. I have owned this vacuum for 4 months now and STILL can not buy replacement filters. Only in the past week have replacement side brushes and rollers been made available. Since filters are supposed to be replaced once a month (as per the manual), this seems like a major oversight by Eufy. Original Review: This is an excellent vacuum. I have hard wood floors with mats all over (in front of the doors, kitchen sink) as well as an area rug (typical carpet, not shag) in the living room. This vacuum does very well cleaning all of it. It runs over the mats and rarely pulls up the edges. I've had this vacuum for a couple months now and run it at least once per week and it has only pulled up the edge of a mat once. But it never stopped the Robovac. The only issue I have with this vacuum is you can not get replacement filters or side brushes for it. So for a while I guess I'll have to clean the filter with water, but that won't last forever. Considering the build quality of the vacuum and the time and energy it saves me from not having to sweep and vacuum the house, I'd love to give the Robovac 11 5-stars. But considering that Eufy must be selling a ton of these and has no way for it's customers to replace the consumable parts of the vacuum, I can't give it the full 5 stars.

R80:	UPDATE 5/1/2017: I wanted to write an update to my review based on my experience with resolving issues with the RoboVac through Eufy's customer support. I have to say, if you're not sure if this will work for you - ORDER IT ANYWAY. I place several *hundred* orders a year through Amazon, mainly because I want to be protected for larger purchases with a simple-to-use return process and policy (which Amazon delivers on). However, this is the first experience I've had with *proactive* direct-connect customer support from Eufy. THey reached out immediately upon my initiation of the return, responded to my messages within hours, if not minutes, and literally had a "tell-us-what-will-make-you-happy-and-we'll-do-it" attitude. I have never updated or come back to report on a review, and the whole experience just shocked me and was such a nice surprise to accompany Amazon's already strong customer service. It made me so much more confident in their products, even though the RoboVac didn't work out for me, I ended up with the Cordless stand-up vacuum instead. I even ended up ordering the Eufy wireless body scale that I forgot I had added to my cart a while ago and was on the fence with - simply because I felt so much more confident that it would be handled well, should anything go wrong. ______________ Ugh - I wanted so badly to be in love with this. So far, all the other Eufy products I have are FANTASTIC! This one just needs an upgrade in a few areas to make it effective and competitive. The suction is nearly ineffective unless you use the "max" button, but there doesn't appear to be a permanent way to make the device apply maximum suction at all times (such as scheduled cleanings, etc.) - it appears to return back to the default level. (I'm assuming this is to conserve power). Definitely +1 star to agree with what all the other reviews have said - even at max, the unit is incredibly quiet. It just doesn't clean effectively. I have hardwood floors and when I sent the unit under my couch (where there is a visible layer of dust) it barely made a dent. In fact, the wheels seemed to pick up more dust off the floor than the brushes themselves. (attached are pics) Returning to Amazon until there is a new updated release or fixes.

R81:	For the first 6 months I was smitten with this vacuum. Loved it!!! Then at around 6 months of use, it kept stopping and giving 2 beeps. No matter what I did, it would stop every 10 minutes, give or take. Kind of defeats the purpose of turning it on while away at work. After trying many suggestions, I called customer service. I swear the guy helping me was a young teenager. He told me to bang on the front of it at which I told him I had done that. He then told me to bang it harder. That was ALL I got. After another 6 months of using it while I was at home so I could restart it when needed, I emailed customer service to see what to do. They replied that if I purchased another they would give me $30. off. Not to sound ungrateful but I saw $30.00 off coupons on some of their products for everyone. I loved it so much that I am going to give it one more try and purchase a second one. I hope this one works longer than 6 months.

R82:	The vacuum doesnt last. I've used It rather sparingly for the last year or so. Today I discovered that 1 of the wheels is stuck. There is no easy way to fix it as it would require opening up the unit and changing out the motor. Since I bought it some time ago, the product is now out of warranty and I'm stuck with a useless paperweight. For something this pricey, I would expect it to last much longer and be much more durable.

R83:	I bought this in 2017 and have used it very lightly to clean a 1 bedroom apartment (~675 square feet). At first it worked well, but after 3 months or so, it picked up less and less dust, hair, and dirt off the floor. I stopped using it after I moved to another apartment that's similar in size. I recently took it out and tried to use it again, but it does not work at all. It doesn't pick up any dirt or dust on hardwood floor or carpet, even after I cleaned out the roller brush.

R84:	I wanted to love this vacuum! I couldn't believe how awesome the reviews were for it and figured that robot vacuums have FINALLY gotten good enough (and affordable enough) that we should purchase one. It just didn't live up to the hype and was so useless since it required a lot of human help. Bad: Maybe our Eufy is defective... but it would give a 3 beep error tone about every 5-10 minutes of vacuuming. This error (according to the manual) says that Eufy is hanging off a ledge or is trapped. This was never true! A lot of times he would just be in the middle of our living room floor, or near a wall - always in areas that would be very easy to continue cleaning. To prove a point, I would hit his start button after he gave the error tone, and he would start back up continuing to do business as usual. Ultimately this is why I returned him. If he can't vacuum without constant help and supervision from me, he doesn't have a purpose. I might as well be vacuuming myself instead of chasing him down to hit his start button every 5-10 minutes. The other thing that I really couldn't get over was the random cleaning patterns. I love good carpet lines, and Eufy makes it look like minions cleaned your house. I was a little embarrassed when people came over because people don't assume you have a robot vacuum and just look at you funny :) If your OCD about that stuff, wait until more tech comes along or go buy a fancy one. I just hadn't realized this was his cleaning method until we bought him. There really wasn't any reviews that mentioned this. Good: There were some really nice things about this model that we loved. I hate vacuuming and just the idea that we could buy an affordable robot to do it for us is so dreamy! Also, we have dog and this vacuum is SO easy to clean the hair out of! The brushes come apart so easily- no tools or muscles needed. The remote is also a nice touch. I loved being able to control the vacuum to go to areas that had been bothering me. I loved having it on a timer and the idea that it was vacuuming the surface area dust everyday without any help from me. Ultimately, I think we're starting to get there... maybe next Christmas there will be better options in this price range. I just can't seem to figure out why everyone else specifically "loves eufy" so much.

R85:	I loved my Eufy from the moment I opened the box ... the amount of dirt and hair that it picked up daily made my stomach turn (but made me extremely happy!) every day he dutifully left his happy charging home to clean up the mess that cats, dog, and foster puppies left behind. Unfortunately he stopped working reliably over the summer- just outside of the warranty. Stopped following his daily schedule, stopped being able to get onto the rug he had so confidently dominated all the months before, so it was time for him to be retired. I got him on a killer sale originally, so for the price he could not be beat. To only have been able to take advantage of him for a year? Not pleasing. However, this guy was such a help in the time I did have him, I’m a little less angry with having to shell out more money such a short time later. TL;DR: Buy if you don’t mind dropping $250+ on a yearly basis for effortlessly clean floors.

R86:	This vac works well and is very quiet as others have mentioned, but it has one major issue that I am not sure I can live with. I have at least 4 pieces of furniture in my house that the Eufy will attempt to go under, but never makes it. The clearance is just too low and the Eufy gets stuck half way underneath the furniture. Considering I planned to have it running when I am at work during the day this is a major deal breaker for me as I cannot depend on it to complete a cycle without being trapped. I have tried for 5 days in a row now since I got it and every time I find it trapped when I get home. Very unfortunate.

R87:	I sent it back. I had a Roomba before this, and it honestly did a better job. It didn't get stuck nearly as often, it cleaned the floors better, and it could properly dock itself. This one required me to get up every ten minutes because it would lodge itself under the fridge or get stuck under a chair. It required more supervision than it was worth. The one pro point is that it didn't seem to choke on pet hair (I have two Shelties and two cats) but then again, I only had it 2 weeks. The Roomba did just fine the first year I had it.

R88:	This unit worked ok. We were happy with how it cleaned dog hair from hardwood floors. However unit stopped working due to a bad corner brush motor. As a result of this one motor not working the unit no longer functions. Reviewed situation with manufacturer and can offer nothing but a 10% discount on a new unit. We will not be buying another euphy. We are very disappointed with the manufacturer not "standing behind their product". They can,t or won't offer a replacement motor. What a joke. We don't want to spend over $200 every 18 months for a new robot vacuum. We do not recommend this product.

R89:	We have had this product for about 2 years. It does a good job keeping the hardwood floors clean (we have a dog and a cat). Overall we have been fairly happy with it. However, it rarely will make it back to the charging station. Usually we would find it about 3 feet away completely dead. A few weeks ago the left wheel quit working. I contacted customer service and was told that its not the wheel that is the issue and that they are not able to send any replacement parts. They provided me the option to purchase a new or refurbished model at a discount. After reading reviews about Eufy the lack of customer support is a problem. We are switching to Roomba now hoping that they support their products and customers at a more satisfactory level. Guess the Eufy is going in the trash can.

R90:	I purchased a Eufy Robovac 11 from amazon.com through your company on October 22, 2017. I loved the vacuum EXCEPT IT STOPPED WORKING THIS LAST WEEK. I will set it to run, and after a minute or two of running it will stop in the middle of the room and the red light will flash as if it is stuck in a corner. Again I will rescue the machine and restart the cleaning program but the same issue keeps occuring. No matter what surface i start it on nor what setting i use nor how many times i restart it the results are the same. I have tried wiping the front sensor plate down with a moist cloth, and tried turning it on and off. This has been happening for a week now and I need assistance in either resolving the issue or replacing the machine. With this problem the machine is very inefficient at vacuuming my house.

R91:	I purchased this vacuum to clean the hardwood floors in my home. WHEN it works, it works great. However, after about 6 months, the sensors failed and the vacuum could not be fixed. Customer service was great and sent me a brand new unit. 7 months after that, one of the side brush motors failed. Customer service imformed me my original 12 month warranty was up and due to strict policy, they couldn't replace it. They offered to sell me a refurbished one at a discounted rate, but I refuse to spend any more money on something that only lasts 6 months. I use this vacuum 3 times a week...that calculates to approximately 75 uses before they fail and cannot be repaired. Completely unacceptable at nearly $300 a piece.

R92:	He can be handy but only if you look him in a room because he doesnt clean systematically. He will zig zag through the hall, make a few passes in a room and go to the next. He NEVER finds his "home." So, when i need him i have to go looking for him then he is usually dead. He gets stuck on everything, including nothing in the middle of the living room.... He does get pet hair up well. If he found his home station & cleaned in a better manner I would like him. The customer service is awesome though and they will make sure that you are happy!

R93:	Had I written a review 12 months ago I would have given this product 5 stars, however now approximately 18 months in (and more importantly out of warranty) I'm giving it 1 star for dying an unfixable death. I really liked the product, though it did not get heavy use in my house because toddlers refuse to pick up after themselves to allow the Eufy to run. Despite what I would call light use during its lifetime, when I ran it a week ago it stopped running mid-cycle and now refuses to work due to what Eufy Customer Support calls a software problem. I expect a product like this to have a life span of longer than 18 months and am very disappointed that there is no replacement fix, short of buying an entirely new unit, after the product died. I'm reconsidering whether to repurchase a robot vacuum from this brand, as I refuse to spent this type of money on a product that will last less then two years with infrequent use.

The only reason I am leaving 3 stars is because it will randomly get stuck in the middle of the floor at random intervals. It is infuriating. UPDATE: Eufy was amazingly helpful, they were quick to send me a replacement after the troubleshooting attempts failed. Would highly recommend even though my first one was an outlier. UPDATE 2: My replacement RoboVac now will not hold a charge. I let it charge over night and will not even roll off the charging doc before dying.

Gets stuck under just about everything. It does make for an enjoyable scavenger hunt when you get home. It will lengthen the time between manual vacuumes if you don't have any carpets or rugs.

R98:	It was nice when it worked, but definitely not worth the money spent. It got stuck or confused frequently, and always missed a few areas (which meant babysitting it and turning it in the right direction--which it doesn't like). The first major frustration was about the 5th time I used it... I tried to put it back on the charging base, but instead of staying there and charging, it kept backing up off the base like it was going to start vacuuming again. By the 7th or 8th time using it (and yes, I emptied it out regularly and checked for tangled brushes, etc.), it simply stopped connecting to the charging base; hence, I rendered it useless. Pretty terrible performance for such an expensive gadget. I ended up hiring a maid.

R99:	It's great when it works. I'm on my second Robo Vac in four months. The first one stopped sensing obstacles, and crashed full speed into walls and furniture. I contacted customer service, and they sent a new one. I packed the broken unit into the same package and sent it back to the manufacturer using a pre-paid postage label. The second one worked for a week before the same thing happened - it quit sensing obstacles and rams into them forcefully. Now, it just sits in one place and spins around until the battery runs out. I'll give Eufy one more chance before I ask for a full refund.

R100:	I really loved this product, then I didn't. It worked great, besides getting stuck under a few pieces of furniture. Then suddenly after over a year of use- it flat out stops working. The only advice I got from the company was to double check I actually plugged it in and properly turned it on. I have been the device for over a year, I think I know how to turn the darn thing on?? They said in every email they have never heard of this happening before. The only remedy they provided was that they could give me 10% off a new product....which based on current pricing would still be more than what I originally paid. So disapoined in this product and customer service.

R101:	I purchased the vacuum June 2017 & have used it almost daily since then! It works perfect on my tile floors. It bounces around the house and I would say cleans about 80% of the floor. For me that good enough so I can walk on floor without feeling dirt sticking to my feet or seeing dust collecting on the floor. 😒 Plus the amount of dust the vacuum picks up it unbelievable! A must for anyone that has small children, animals, and/or indoor allergies! My vacuum recently started to have issues with its bummer. I called the company and they will be sending me a new vacuum free of charge (the vacuum has a 1 year warranty). I would definitely recommend this vacuum to anyone with hard flooring!

R103:	This little vacuum worked great for the first year. Great for keeping down the general amount of dust and hair on the floor. However, after about a year, the navigation and battery-life began to deteriorate. At first the robot would almost never run into furniture, but would slow to a stop before changing directions. Now, it hits everything at full speed before bouncing away. Battery life is down to about 30-40 minutes and it is no longer able to find its docking station. The initial performance of this product, especially considering the price, easily gets 4.5-5 stars. But a 1-1.5 year period of usefulness makes this a borderline disposable product, so I have to reduce its rating.

R104:	We've loved our Eufy for a little over a year now. The fact that the rollers, wheels, battery, filters are replaceable make it a great choice. However we are now having problems with the front bumper getting stuck and the vacuum spinning until it turns off. I took it apart but nothing is easily fixed with this part. Contacted customer service, they were unable (unwilling) to help, citing a strict adherence to a 1 year warranty. To say the least, we are frustrated with customer service on the other end of our emails and phone calls. BUYER BEWARE: if your Eufy breaks a day after the 12 month warranty is up, you will get zero response from the company, and ultimately, you're screwed. I do not recommend Eufy and I do not recommend RoboVac.

R106:	Works great when it actually runs. Good suction and runs under the furniture. However, it began to shut down as if full after I turned it on for a few minutes. I haven't used it for awhile because of this. Previously I would try to use it, and give up after needed to turn the alarm off and reset. I thought maybe something was stuck in it, but it wasn't. I thought it wasn't charging properly, but it is. I loved this when it arrived, Today, I looked at it again thinking I could fix it, but nope, still shut down after a couple minutes. Always runs, after I hit the button, but might as well run the regular sweeper. I bought this to use when the grandkids were here because who has the time to vacuum with kids to play with?

R107:	We purchased a Eufy RoboVac 11c in late summer 2017 and initially were very pleased. Unfortunately, within about a year it stopped working. I should add that it was very lightly used in a small house with all wood flooring. Fortunately, Eufy customer service sent us a reconditioned unit. This replacement was always a bit underpowered/low on battery life compared to the first model, and it stopped working after we had it for about five months (only used for about three months of that time). At that point, we were out of warranty and out of luck. In all, that was two Eufy RoboVacs that together didn't last 16 months of light use. Purchase price is low, as is the quality and durability.

R109:	My husband bought this for me as a birthday gift in October. Worked wonderfully at first, my husband and I were thrilled with how well it worked and picked things up. By November it started running into small issues. Brushes were getting tangled on themselves and we had to replace them within 2 months. Then it started running into things, and we had to clean the sensors before each use which only helped slightly. Then it started to make grinding noises and spin in circles, becoming unusable. We contacted Eufy first and they would not replace since we did not buy directly from them. We contacted the seller ,hoping they could provide some assistance with it being brand new and they have ignored our emails. Basically we spent $200 for 2 months of use.

R110:	This was quite an investment for us, but with three pets and renting my son's room out for airbnb while away at college I needed something I could run every other day and not have to lug the vacuum out. I did a lot of research and this got great reviews for pet hair, my biggest issue. It worked great at first but then slowly started to lose its power. Then it started doing circles even though we had the settings set for the full room. As of now it works intermittently and has lost a lot of suction. I've seen go right over a piece of lint on the floor and not take it in. I expected to get more than a year's use out of it. Glad I waiting to write my review until now.

R111:	I’ve owned this product for 15 months and diligent about cleaning the product well after every other use clearing hair from all rollers and washing out the dust compartment sans the paper filter and air drying. I did love it when it was working but one day it started to beep (4times with siolid red light) and stopped working after about a minute of use even when restarted. There is a defect to which the only solution from the company is to use the warranty for replacement. Warranty is 12 months. No troubleshooting or parts department to help therefore making this product disposable from the company’s standpoint should it stop working after the 12 month period. I went from loving the product to being disappointed to learn that the cheaper price tag means disposable.

R118:	Loved this vacuum when it worked. I would call ourselves light users - ~900 square feet, used once a week for about 30 minutes to an hour. Bought July 2017, and stopped working November 2018. We now get the dreaded 4 beeps error after the vacuum has run for about 10 seconds. Troubleshooting steps through Eufy have been unsuccessful. Took the thing apart and it seems as though the main brush motor has seized, but there are no replacement parts available - the best option through their support is 15% off a new vacuum. We loved the vacuum but it is not worth paying $230 every 16 months for a new replacement.

R119:	Bought in September of 2017. Worked great for a year, then it would only charge for about 20 minutes and start beeping with red light. The short charge was enough though to keep it going reasonably well for the last several months. But suddenly it doesn’t turn on at all, and won’t charge. My eufy has passed the surly bonds of my floor and is now resting peacefully in the trash. Have owned a few Roombas in the past and they all died between 1 and 1.5 years. At least this one was cheaper than the Roombas with basically same performance.

R120:	We loved this vacuum until the sensors went haywire. At first it only happened while charging. After several hours on the charger the pulsing blue light turned solid red and it started to beep loudly 4 times, which means the rolling brush is stuck. Odd since it was not even in use. Nevertheless tried all the troubleshooting suggestions I could find, including charging the thing without the rolling brush or brush cover attached. Eventually it starting to have the same issue while vacuuming as well. I looked for a replacement rolling brush but they do not seem to be available for this model.

I have cleaned it thoroughly and it still has "beeping errors" constantly and stops running. It is not lodged under furniture or stuck in any way. It will just stop in the middle of the floor and start beeping. ***Update**** We were contacted after leaving the above review and were shipped a new device free of charge. We received it yesterday. I have not used it yet but the customer service is amazing.

R122:	Disappointment OVERALL: 2.5/5 Marginal at best. I really wanted to like this after reading over the reviews, and in about 5 years, these robotic vacuums will be awesome, but they're not there yet. It does a decent job at picking up dust, but there are major downsides, and you won't want to keep this for more than a few months. I am returning mine to Amazon. Make sure you go through the reviews and try to weed out fake reviews on the website. Note there are external websites that do this for you if you do a search. PICKING UP DUST: 3.5/5. It works about as well as a small hand held vacuum that you take around to pick up small messes. So, you won’t get much power on anything besides a hardwood/tile floor or very thin carpet. It does work on standard carpets, but not that well. Definitely a step down from a standard vacuum cleaner, and no comparison to a steam cleaner. You will be surprised at the amount of dust it can gather though. BATTERY: 3/5. Advertised for 1.5-2 hours? The BEST I got was an hour. Expect that to decrease over time as the battery dies RECHARGING: 1/5. It takes 3+ hours to get the full charge. TIMER MODE: 2/5. This almost never automatically works for me and I followed instructions perfectly. MANEUVERABILITY: 2.5/5. It is just so dumb. The random mode will take it all around the room, but it will go into a wall at an angle, then it will turn 5 degrees, go forward, then bump into the same wall, then turn 5 degrees, then repeat and repeat. Then it will sometimes do an about face and go elsewhere. There is no rhyme or reason to where it goes. MODES: 2/5. There is an auto mode, a spot cleaning mode, a periphery cleaning mode, etc. Auto is the go-to, and it is no good. Spot cleaning is pointless – just get your vacuum cleaner if you spilled something. Periphery mode is good, unless you want the actual room cleaned. RETURNING TO STATION: 1/5. It returned for me in 10% of cases. And that was almost always in the periphery cleaning mode. When it leaves the charging station, it usually pulls the station along with it a little bit, making it hard to dock later. VALUE: 2/5. At $180, this is not worth it. It’s better than the competitors, but not by much. But just wait for a few years when these things are <$100 and have better software. PHOTOS: one of the photos is how much dust I got in a few hours of cleaning a 14 x 12 room. It’s a lot! Another photo is how I would randomly find the Robovac – sometimes almost near the recharge station, usually NOWHERE CLOSE. 3rd photo is how the vacuum pulls out the charging station.

R123:	Update: its been exactly a year since we got this vac, loved it, and on the one year anniversary . it stopped working. Charges while on station but then won't actually hold the charge (or work). Tried buying a new battery $70 in total and has not worked. Now we are on a search for a new robo vac. Original Review: LOVE. Shedding dogs, all I need to say! Super easy to just put down on hard wood floors or carpet and watch it go. Picked up dust, pet hair, human hair, etc. and leaves so much longer in-between general cleanings (if needed). First robot vacuum and super impressed! Definitely a member of the family now.

R125:	My expectations were low and they’ve been met. This is our third machine and it lasted 1 year and 3 months. Bought cheap because they just don’t last. This one did not map and seemed completely random. Can’t find its way home usually. But now it has pretty much stopped. It runs maybe 10 feet and starts beeping that its wheel is stuck. I have cleaned wheels and removed debris and blown air. Bin fell apart within days and it had to be held together with bag ties. It routinely hung up over heat vent covers.

R126:	I bought one 7 months ago and I’ll be on my (hopefully soon) third replacement Eufy. I liked and raved about the Eufy because it’s a lot quieter and didn’t seem to get stuck as often as the Roomba. But I’m questioning the dependability and durability. I’ve also been waiting for the soon-to-be third replacement for a month now, customer service keeps pushing the replacement date back. To note, my apartment is 700 sq ft and all wood flooring and no rugs, not a difficult setting at all.

I’d let it run and come back to clean floors. Unfortunately last 2 months it has been acting out always stopping and beeping. Beeping as if something is stuck but I changed the filter and constantly check to see if anything is stuck and nothing is. Very upset that it lasted under a year.

EVERYONE.) Suddenly, it has started malfunctioning. (Immediately stops running and gives error codes that the side brush is stuck or the suction is clogged -- but those issues have been addressed and it still doesn't work and gives me those same codes.) I've contacted support but, based on some of the other reviews, I assume they'll tell me that because the original purchase was more than 12 months ago they won't help me.

R134:	Bought the Robovac 11 in March of 2018. The product worked pretty well--, especially on hardwood. However it stopped working at the end of June 2019 and would just circle and circle. I saw a youtube video with the same problem. So I took it apart and cleaned it. When I put it back together, it worked for an hour and reverted back to the same circling problem caused by the bumper. It appears to me that the bumper "spring" on one side has lost some of it's elasticity. Good vac, poor reliability.

R136:	So, this thing wasn't the best, but it wasn't the worst, and it got the job done. We have a modest sized home and it's mostly wood floors, about 1,000 square feet. After a couple of months, the battery is kaput. Doesn't even make it a quarter of the house before dying. It's completely useless now, and cost several hundred dollars to be a paperweight. I rarely flat out tell people to not buy a product, but please avoid this. Regret this purchase 100%.

R139:	Single story 2000 sq ft house;l tile, and this vac would run about 80% of the floor plan. It has a small receptacle, so I found it best to monitor and dump waste every 20 min (collects fine dust and pet hair). It worked nice as something to do light maintenance in between thorough cleanings. However, after about 2.5 months of light once weekly use, the machine now throws an error code and can't sense surroundings. It just freaks out immediately after start and spins 360's, 45 degrees at a time. Eufy needs better customer service.

R149:	First Eufy's computer went wonky, but we were sent a replacement because it was still under warranty. Replacement Eufy started making a very loud noise similar to a leaf blower. Eufy would not repair or replace the second vacuum because they went off the original purchase date, and even though we hadn't had the replacement Eufy for very long, it was no longer under warranty.

R153:	Purchased the vacuum in October 2017 for my wife's birthday. We occasionally used it and were happy with how it worked. Now (late November 2018) it keeps throwing an error that the side brush it stuck. We've cleaned it, attempted to use WD40 and nothing works. I reached out to customer service and the only help they offer is 10% off a new one or an $80 refurbished one. We spent $230 on this vacuum, it shouldn't be garbage especially considering the amount of us. Spend a little more money for better customer service, reliability and invisible walls (this thing runs around aimlessly).

Sometimes it goes in circles even if I perfectly cleaned the sensors and there are no obstacles. I liked it so much but I’m disappointed that it stopped working after 2 years and I’ve been using it max once a week! I’d say spend more to buy a Rumba.

R157:	So I bought this robot in Feb. 2017. It arrived, packaging looks fine, everything is shiny and new. For the first week or two I fight trying to get the automatic time set up correctly, only to realize it had a firmware issue of some sort and had to be exchanged by the manufacturer. Next robot worked fine for a couple months, then one day I came home to it sitting in the middle of the living room, as if it ran out of charge on the way back to the dock. Picked it up and put it back on the dock, thinking it just needed to charge. Next day, it went to start up at its scheduled time, but immediately gave its error beeps instead. Thinking perhaps I hadn't set it quite right on the charger, I turned it off and resettled it there. Unfortunately, that wasn't it, and even after letting it charge for another day, and doing several hard resets, it still wouldnt run. Frustrating, but the customer service has been truly excellent. Quick response, willingness to quickly ship replacements - really feels like the company makes it a high priority to ensure these things are working. Even after two haven't worked, this excellent service as well as the apparently good build quality of the things makes me think it's worth trying another. If they robots were really breaking down often for everyone, no way they could afford to keep this level of service up!

A few months later it breaks again now insurance is telling me to contact eufy to see if they will cover the product. Just a chore all around for this machine. Stay away not worth it spend the couple extra hundred dollars and avoid these headaches the machine wasn't even abused!! it had one floor and no real obstacles to worry about.

R159:	Eufy was great at the beginning. She’s been on the decline. Sometimes she can’t find her way back to her charging station. Sometimes she can’t make transitions from the hardwood to carpet. My carpets are pretty low too. She use to be able to vacume by sons playmat with ease, she gets stuck at certain points in the mat like there’s something in her way but there’s nothing in front of it. She just goes back and forth like she’s stuck and then that requires me to pick her up and move her. She gets emptied regularly, she gets the hair that gets caught in her wheels removed and her filter gets cleaned. She just seems to have lost her way.

R160:	Looks great. After chasin the unit down with my remote I realized that wifi capability that I learned some other brands have would have been extremely useful. Also it's a little noisy and the return to dock in station feature didn't always work! If you have never used one of these like me you will be amazed how much crap is under your couches bed etc. this thing filled up with dust and debris exceeding my expectations. Works great on the carpet as well. This thing even picked up a straw and didn't stop working. I didn't know until I cleaned out the collector tray. My rating is more because of the lack of wifi. I think if you don't care about that you will love it.

R173:	2nd robovac, I bought this to replace Neato XV sig-pro after 2 years of use battery and long standing dust bin glitches finally wore it out. Pro: super quiet, good suction (just as good as Neato), big easy to use waste bin, 3 layer air filter. Con: stupid, the thing has no rhyme or reason to its cleaning "pattern" making it overly inefficient both in time and cleaning. Scheduling sometimes it runs when it's supposed to, sometimes it doesn't, lately it's been staring randomly in the middle of the night. No screen or digital feedback remote not very effective. Neato was easier to schedule and gave better feedback so you knew what it was doing or needed. Neato's pattern may have spoiled me, it is why I choose over Roomba as my first robovac, it was very logical and efficient, Eufy is entirely the opposite. Doesn't go over area rugs as well as Neato. Have to update this after about 8 months this thing is just awful. It is attracted to people and the dogs we have moved through the room and it will essentially follow you from area to area and ride around your feet. Its is almost like the thing tries to get stuck, it runs so unorganized it's just terrible. The scheduler no longer works for schedule it to run. I'm going office space on it and throwing it away just not worth the aggregation. Really regret this purchase I researched the heck out of it too.

R174:	I wish I could love it, but I am disappointed. It never finds its charging station when the battery is dead. It was working properly for 1 week but now it just stopped working. It was in the process of running a standard cleaning cycle, and it started beeping. I checked on it, and the unit was flashing blue indicator light with a 3 beep sequence. I assume the battery was low. I put it on the charging base, it was beeping 3 times again. Maybe I should return it.

The error is red light, 2 beeps, which indicates a side brush issue, but no troubleshooting could fix it. It is now out of warranty. I wouldn't waste your money. Really disappointed.

R176:	We use our vacuum every single day. The object detection sensors stop working after a few weeks now it just runs into everything. Before it would slow down and avoid objects, now it just slams into all my furniture at full speed. It also seems to have a hard time finding its home base after a few months, it finds it less and less frequently. We got a replacement unit since we were still under warranty but had the same problems. I'm planning on getting another replacement vacuum right before the warranty runs out and hope it works

R179:	It started out as a wonderful relationship, my little Eufy along with my 2 Neat VX's attacked my house like cleaning stormtroopers. Eufy always had more energy and lasted the longest. Unfortunately, I think my little Eufy is very unhappy with its new life. Last week it started flashing and crying after only working for a few minutes. I contacted customer support and they advised me to give it a good shaking. Eufy acted happy yesterday, but today once again I think it is depressed, in fact suicidal. 4 times today Eufy tried to kill itself by jumping down the basement stairs. It does it purposely as it will sense the stairs back up and then turn around backing down the stairs. Poor Eufy, if he keeps this up I will have to have it euthanized. UPDATE I figured out the issue was caused by a cracked glass. Whatever you do do not use rubbing alcohol to clean the screen. It will melt the film covering the tempered glass.

Contacted Amazon's eclaimsline.com because I bought the vacuum using an Amazon Visa so that should have doubled the 12 month warranty. They declined the claim saying that this behavior is is an "inherent design flaw" so beware.

R184:	This was an excellent vacuum for the first month. Easy to set up. Worked great the first week. I almost ordered a second one as a gift because I loved it so much. However, each week there were more beeps and Eufy resets. By the fifth week, Eufy would usually run an hour max before having to be cleaned or reset. Now I have owned Eufy for 6 weeks and it will not run for more than 5 seconds without the unit beeping to let me know that the roller brush is stuck. I have cleaned out every orifice of this device and it will not work. It's too late to return it so now I'm stuck with a very expensive vacuum that doesn't work at all. I have a feeling all of the positive reviews are from people like me that were so happy at first. Maybe I got a dud.

However, the last 3 times I tried to use it, it wouldn't even get started, and it’s been sitting on the charger with the light indicating it is charged. It's used in 2 rooms 2 times a week. It worked nicely and picked up a lot of dirt. But suddenly it just doesn't want to leave the home base anymore.

The lights flash and the battery indicates it is charging. The other issue is this vac keeps getting stuck underneath my couches, tables, etc and I have to move the vac in order for it to finish that area. A vac at this price range should last more than 4 months. I probably should have done more research before purchasing.

R194:	Does not like rugs that have a dark boarder so I often have to get it unstuck. Works well in open rooms, but seams to go over the same spot over and over again. I often find that I have to use the remote to make it go to a different area. I have 3 large dogs and it does well with picking up the hair. I have yet to have it go back to the home base by its self. Definitley helps in the hard to reach places like under the beds and couchs. I do not recomend if you have a lot of carpet.

R204:	FINAL UPDATE: I bought a Neato Connected and it is SENSATIONAL. It completely maps your home each cleaning with LIDAR. Works in no light, vacuums every square inch of my floor plan and closets, then returns to base 100% of the time. I have a lot of sq ft, so it cleans til low on batt, returns for a charge, then picks up exactly where it left off. It has a full brush and EXCELLENT suction. A M A Z I N G! Perfect vac UPDATE: After living with the Eufy for 10-15 cleanings, the conclusions are quite clear, and none were never described in any of the many writte/youtube reviews I researched before buying. They are: the Robovac (and all the competition) must be within about 15 feet of the charging base, and facing it, when it gets low on battery, or the chance of it finding its base is inversely proprtional to your house size beyond that small arc. There are no other factors, because movements are random and it has no awareness of position. This is such a critical point that I can't believe none of the (100s?) of vac reviews I read ever mentioned it. Armed with the knowledge that there is no position awareness, or radio homing, or anything that could actually work, that makes a buying decision quite easy: If you have a simple floor area of say, 750 sq ft or less with a clear view of the base, a robot vac will work reliably for you as advertised. If you have more that floor area or it is complex, then the chances of the vac blindly wandering back into that arc, the base before i it dies, drops precipitously with more sq footage. So the obvious, cost-effective answer is to add more charging bases. Why this is not discussed in any of the product ads I've seen is beyond me. The are more expensive vacs with some primitive mapping functions, but reviews are so so, and frankly, once you understand the general stupidity of these bots, the much cheaper and more reliable solution is going to be a multi-base solution. The bases look and feel like they should retail for under $10. So all that said, it appears the Eufy line does not sell additional bases, but other visually near identical bots do. The iLifes and the Deebots sell bases for $25 each. So I took a chance and bought a base for an iLife and deebot to see if it would work with Eufy, but no luck. Today Eufy left a comment to contact them, suggesting they might send an additional base for "my situation" (meaning: I live in a full scale house). Nice of them, but I would need at least two more, and this info should be in the product description of all vac bots. So the answer is this: if you have a house without a continuous line of site to a charging base, buy a bot that sells additional bases. Its a much more cost effective solution than a gold plated bot, and is surely more reliable. ---------- 3rd UPDATE: Unfortunately, even after Eufy proofing my entire 1st floor, he bot keeps finding new ways to get stuck. It's almost like its real intelligence is fightingy efforts. It rarely completes a cleaning without: 1) getting hung up, or 2) randomly being too far away when return to base mode kicks in, too close to dying. Great try, but it just doesn't work automatically which is the main point. Small floorplans where the base is always in and few sharp corners would have fewer issues. 2nd UPDATE: This bot apears to be identical in every way to the Deebot N79, which is $20 cheaper and adds a wifi link in addition to the identical remote. It also appears to be an exact match with the iLife A4, which is also cheaper. UPDATE: Relocating the base in my largest room, plus blocking common jam areas (only a few nooks) has increased auto-docking chances to around 30%. The only reason auto docking improved from near 0% to 30% is because the probability of being in or near the lafgest room, when low power docking mode kicks in, is about 30% based on square feet. I think the Robovac 11 would work MUCH better if it auto-docked at about half power instead of 5-10 minutes from dead. Cleaning is still a little better than expected, but if you have a large or complex floor plan, you probably need a smarter/mapping robot vac. upgrading to 3 stars. ----------------------------- I've only had the RoboVac for two days, so I hope to update this review with a better overall experience. At first I was disappointed, then kind of ok with the purchase, then disappointed again. First impression: the vacuum pattern seemed very random, and my 2400 sq ft downstairs is quite complex. The combination of the two makes for sporadic cleaning and a generally confused robot. Next impression, considering the reasonable long battery battery life and cleaning time, the Eufy seemed to achieve descent coverage. I figured, if it runs each night, it'll work. It does pickup an amazing amount of dirt. With several cats, it fills the internal container in one use, no complaints, hopefully that will get better with time. Don't expect it to deep clean your carpets, its mostly a surface sweep, but it vacuums better than I expected from a crawling disk. Unfortunately, mostly negating my starting to like it better ofr cleaning utility, the bot has yet to relocate its charging dock, and so it winds up beeping help after every attempted cleaning. The roaming pattern seems to have no intelligence at all, and even when it has direct line of sight to its charger, it still fails to dock before dying. Don't know if this purchase is going to work out, considering returning for a pricier/smarter model. If you have a straightforward floor plan, I think it would work a lot better.

R207:	It does a really nice job, when it doesn't get stuck underneath a piece of furniture. It's great on hardwood/laminate floors; it picked up a messy flour spill quickly and efficiently. But I can't leave it alone to run while we're at work because it always gets stuck somewhere. Kinda defeats the purpose of an automatic vacuum cleaner. I contacted eufy and they wanted me to take a video of it when it gets stuck. So am I supposed to sit there and watch it for 1.5 hours to see if it might get stuck? Thinking about returning it and trying something else.

I updated my review based upon their responsiveness. Hoping that the one I got was just a dud. We loved it while it worked. Not sure if the technology is 100% there? Already broken. I've gone through every instruction and cleaned/replaced every part. Multiple times. Just broken. :(

R209:	Well, I purchased this in December 2016, it's now May 2017 and I held my review to see how well this lasted. To be fair, the RoboVac11, while it lasted was decent for the price. It required a lot of maintenance and cleaning, and with my particular carpet, the carpet fibers became attached to the brushes, I had to use a steel brush to clean it every time I used it. It seems the Roomba brush, which looks to be rubber with no brushes would be better suited for me. Right now my unit's light turns red and beeps 4 times over and over again and will no longer function. Eufy customer service says that it's a defect either with the brush or debris in the bumper, but will not replace it. They will give me a $15 discount on the 11c and no discount on the new 11s. Basically, I'm left with nothing, and going to get a Roomba. I like you Eufy, but stand behind your products. 1.5 years is nothing.

I disassembled the entire system, cleaned out all the dust, hair, and the like. I confirmed the bearings of the brush spin freely and the brush motor also spins without issue. After reassembly, I got the same fault. I thought it might be a low battery voltage not able to produce the required torque to spin the brush, so I left it switched off on the charger for ~16hr. No luck

R220:	The product worked for about 4 1/2 weeks. Just long enough to not return it to Amazon. After it broke all calls to the company for help have thus far gone unanswered, I sat on hold for an hour and a half on one call. After I gave up and selected the option to have them call me back, its been over a week and no one has called. The product itself (when it worked) was serviceable enough, it wasn't perfect but it was 'helpful'. It often got stuck, and didn't return to its base. But it was reasonably effective at picking up dust/dirt while it was vacuuming. It wasn't a complete replacement for vacuuming, but it helped cut down the weekly effort. After roughly a month mine started giving errors. It would give an error that the sensors are dirty, so you'd clean that out and then it immediately gives you an error the vacuum is clogged, so I cleared that out and it gives me an error the brush is stuck, so i'd remove and clean that. Then it'd go back to saying the sensors are dirty. It just continuously goes in this circle of errors no matter what I do to it. It will not clean/work anymore. I called the company as I am now outside of my Amazon return window however, the customer service is completely non-existent. Its pretty clear they don't stand by their product. For the price, its a gamble.. if you get one that works then you got a good deal. If you get one that breaks.... whether under warranty or not, you're not getting any help, so its toast.

I called the company to see how I can fix it, they said, there is no way to fix it. It is unfixable. And because I am calling 4 days after the warrantee is up, tough luck. So apparently they sold me a vacuum that can't be fixed. I offered to buy the part to make it work, but they said, unfortunately, you can't fix a Eufy vacuum. If I had know this, I wouldn't have bought it. I showed them my records from Google where I searched how to fix it-- but that's not good enough for them. Caveat Emptor!

R232:	My Robovac 11 is OK, but I expected a lot more, even from a low end robot vacuum. The vacuum power feels a little too weak with the brushes comparatively too strong, so often times the vac just bats dust or fluffies around the home. Unless debris winds up right underneath the Eufy, the debris can often just wind up getting kicked out from the backside as it moves on. The remote control is admittedly cool, but I wound up having to use it frequently because the robot tends to have difficulty leaving the starting area, and especially moving between rooms, or even semi-divided open areas (it has trouble passing my couch, TV, and coffee table to get to the kitchen, so it winds up going back and forth over the same area rug repeatedly). The vac is also prone to getting stuck with laundry (a given with robot vacs), sliding doors (not cool), tall soft edges (it dug into then couldn't escape the side of my Jaxx bean-bag sofa), and has troubles with table + chair areas (sadly also expected). RoboVac handles edges with a few questions. In some cases, it approaches the edge, then turns away from it while still about 3 inches away. In other cases, it does a little creative maneuver with a bump rotate and move back into it...bump approach, but the logic seems to prefer going in one direction over another, and there's no button to trigger it, so to clean some edges I just had to repeatedly tell it to run into the wall, and in one or two cases I got so frustrated I had to pick it up and put it in the right spot. The rollers and side brushes seem ok in the short term maintenance-wise, but the filters feel like they fill up really fast, particularly if you're on any kind of carpet. You really have to empty the dust bin and clear the basic "lint" filter every single time the vac runs. I feel like clever design could have allowed the HEPA filter to be double, or perhaps even tripled in surface area with very little cost impact, thus allowing more suction power to make it through to the ground, and a more durable consumer product with slightly higher costing supplies costing everyone significantly less to ship (in total). All in all, I feel like it does make my life a little easier, but it takes a lot of looking after. If playing with gadgets is your thing, this may be up your alley. I believe the most important improvements that could be made are with area mapping logic, sensor logic, and filter design (which can enhance suction/overall cleaning power). Or just get a maid.

R243:	I loved, loved, loved this little guy for the first two months I had it. (I’ve had it six months now.) Amazing how it zooms around and under to suck up stuff. Using it 3-4x/wk has kept the floors and rugs cleaner overall, and the house is less dusty. It definitely slows down on areas that are all carpet, like the bedrooms, so I don’t use it as much as I should. I love that it will go under the bed no problem though. The reason I took away two stars: 1) there is a rubber flap that I guess help push dirt into the dustbin. Mine started to break off one side after about three weeks and by the sixth week, I had to snip off half of the flap because it was just dragging on the floor. I guess I would have to special order a whole new yellow bracket just to get a whole rubber flap. I don’t want to do that already. 2) About 8 weeks in, I turned on the little guy and let him roam. A few minutes later, I smelled POO. I tracked it down and it was coming from the Eufy. Apparently, my puppy had a (rare) house accident and the Eufy decided to scoop it up. Yup. Fresh poo all over the inside, brushes, and in the tread of the wheels. And then spreading it across the floor as it went on its merry way. I carefully and painstakingly cleaned every nook and cranny, ensuring everything was dry before I ran it again. It still works, but the sensors aren’t quite as keen as they were before. There’s much more bumping into things and getting stuck on things that weren’t a problem before. I keep the Eufy very clean, and have noticed the sensors improved a bit over time. But they’re just not like they were at first. I would have thought they’d have seen poo as too big to try to sweep (even if it was little puppy poo). Now when I run it, I do a quick survey to ensure the pup hasn’t left another surprise before Eufy does his chores.

I've tried all the cleaning methods and still cannot figure out how to get rid of the clicking. We are also having trouble scheduling the Eufy. It never wants to find its way home either.

R253:	This worked great in the beginning but 4 months later it has become slower, stops and beeps a lot for no reason, and won't stay charged like it used to. It used to vacuum several rooms at a time but now only does about one before needing to recharge. I spend more time chasing it around and restarting it then it would take me to just use my dyson vacuum.

R254:	I really wanted to like this little guy. As many have posted, it is very quiet and does a decent job of cleaning. However, it kept cancelling out the scheduled time for running (which kind of defeats the purpose of having it if it doesn't run). When it did run, it would end up getting stuck between the legs of my kitchen chairs (my chair legs and the RoboVac are apparently the same width). RoboVac wasn't smart enough to avoid this. It also would get stuck on our cushioned floor mats in the kitchen and would have to be moved by hand. Then, after about a week, the unit indicated it's battery wasn't charged after running for about 1.5 minutes. Had to send it back.

The capacity to hold the dirt is very good. The battery works about 1,5 hours but take to much time to recharge. It’s good that can clean my cats’s hair

R284:	Wanted to love it!!! Have been waiting for a long time to buy one. Read reviews on The Sweethome website and this was their fav after a lot of testing. But the battery didn't last as long for me and it could not get the corners. It did a great job of what it did pick up, a really great job but for more than $200 I guess I looked forward to more. I wish it completed a room in a very organized pattern from one end to another. But it bounces around the room without any definite path. If it hits a piece of furniture it's like a pinball, it can head in any direction when it bounces off. Sometimes it kept going back to the same spot. Sometimes it flung itself across the room and totally missed an area. It would eventually get to the area, as long it wasn't a corner but the way it got around the room drove me a bit bonkers. One of the roomba models completes the room in a straight pattern from end to end, would be great if this one did too.

R285:	I had the Eufy for a week before it fell down the stairs. It's ability to judge stairs is over-stated. Their customer support says that my stairs are too dark. If you have wood stairs, this product isn't for you. Another major design flaw of the Eufy is that it's top is made of glass. After taking a spill down the stairs, the vacuum's top shattered into thousands of glass shards. Not something you'd want to happen if you have pets or children. The last and worst part of the experience is the company's customer support. after promising a replacement, I got the round around. They never mentioned they wanted me to return the old one in any correspondence. After 10 emails back and forth over several weeks, that was something they should have mentioned. Eufy RoboVac 11, High Suction, Self-Charging Robotic Vacuum Cleaner with Drop-Sensing Technology and High-Performance Filter for Pet, Designed for Hard Floor and Thin Carpet Since I disposed of the broken vacuum, I am out hundreds of dollars.

R309:	I have never owned a "robo-vac" of any kind so I have no reference point for personal comparisons. I'll simply relay my brief but dismal experience. I placed the charger base in my kitchen (hardwood floor), nearby the carpet border with my living room. When I start the vac, it backs out, drives across the open area and immediately ran into a nic-nac shelf. It backed up and "maneuvered" around the obstacle and then proceeded onto the carpet. I don't have long carpet but the vacuum struggled mightly to drive around on it. It even just stopped moving completely and started beeping at me. I carried the unit back to the charger and tried again. This time, it started the exact same way running into the shelf, driving around, but it successfully traversed the carpet for about 10-15 minutes before getting stuck under a rocker-recliner. Ugh! I carried it back to the charger and tried again, this time I was forcing it to stay in the kitchen area by blocking it at the carpet edge. I watched it scurry around my kitchen floor and was very disappointed as I watched it fling the small bits of dry cat food that were on the floor. Next, I watched as it rammed into the cat's water dish and sloshed water all over the floor. Finally, it drove onto the heater grate in the kitchen and got stuck and was unable to move - it was "high centered" on a standard heater duct grate. I turned it off and carried it back to the kitchen table to pack this mobile trash heap back into the box and send it back. For what it's worth, it did seem to pick up a decent amount of dirt out of the carpet in the 15 minutes it was actually vacuuming the carpet. I can't say the same thing for the hardwood floor. Maybe it would have done better had it not got stuck on the air grate. The amount of time spent babysitting would be better spent just getting out my Dyson and vacuuming myself.

R313:	The Eufy 11 is as good as these robot vacuums get. Sit back and let it do all the work. It does a good job of cleaning both low pile carpet and hard floors (wood/tile/marble). Easy to empty bin and handy remote control. So why only 1 star? Well, as is not uncommon on any appliance, there are parts that need occasional replacement such as the side rollers, filter, and main roller (all very reasonably priced IF AVAILABLE). Eufy sells more robot vacs than anyone yet there are no, and I repeat no accessories available for purchase either through Amazon or directly through Eufy. Sans the ability to buy replacement parts, this unit is not a wise purchase. Without working rotating side brushes, this unit is worthless. If I were a betting man, I'd say the company is just selling out their stock of this model, not manufacturing the accessories for it, and will introduce a newer, updated model in short order. Mine's going back this week for a refund,

R314:	Physically a product but unfortunately it has a flaw that makes it stop with no reason or alert and does not return to the base automatically as supposed to be. Also you may notice that it gets stuck easily in small spaces or under the donning table and makes lots of attempts to get out doing the same over and over. Seems like the algorith that controls the movements is poorly designed. On the other hand, the suction is amazing and this together with the rotating brush makes a great job cleaning hard floors and carpets. My Wife was actually loving it but since we started facing the issues we are really disappointed with the product. Update: I have returned and bought a second one, ans still having the same issue. It stops without any alert or presenting an apparent issue. Still liking it because it keeps all floors very clean but we need to keep and eye on it. Returned after getting 2 units with same issues.

R321:	UPDATE: After posting this review, customer service reached out to me and sent me a replacement RoboVac 11 free of charge. The new unit continues to function as expected ~2 months after receiving it. While this does not speak directly to the RoboVac 11, it does reinforce the fact that Eufy stands behind their product. I am extremely displeased with this product and the service that Eufy customer support provided to date. I purchased the RoboVac 11 in March 2017 and it stopped working in April of 2018, approximately 2 weeks after the 1-year warranty expired. We do not have pets and only ran it once ever couple weeks across 20% carpet and 80% hardwoods. It was lightly used at best. Similar to other reviews, the vacuum now gives an error as if something (a motor or brush) is stuck and therefore no longer functions. All spin with no obvious signs of increased friction. After contacting customer support, i was told that there was nothing they could do regarding replacing the device, and when I inquired about options to replace one or more parts, they indicated that was not possible and sent me a generic youtube video explaining how to do a basic brush cleaning. With a $200 price point, i would expect far better reliability and improved customer service for this type of product. I am extremely disappointed with Eufy and will be hesitant to purchase a Eufy product again after the negative experience with the product and customer service.

R343:	I bought my robovac kn October and sad to say it finally took its last breath in may. This thing was A life saver , excellent suction, very quiet, and as long as you handle the big stuff eufy was perfect handling the rest. The last week or so eufy started beeping red more often. First it was the brush constantly being stuck, then it turned into a the bumper stuck problem. The bumper sucl problem persists no matter what fixes you try to give. For this reason I have to give it 3 stars. I would hope my investment at least made it a calendar year before biting the dust. Of course this is the only appliance I ever bought from Amazon without added warranty SMh. Great product, short life span

R350:	While the vacuum does pick up quite a bit of hair, it almost never makes it through a full cleaning cycle without multiple issues like getting stuck on baby gear, or a thick rug. When it works, it's great but when it starts beeping for whatever reason (almost every time we use it) it's annoying. However, I am aware that this is a MUCH cheaper robot vacuum so I kept it for that reason.

R352:	For about $200 you get a fun toy that cleans well, is quiet, fits under small spaces and helps keep your place clean. The downside is the algorythm it uses is not very well designed. Example - if you use the remote and tell it to go somewhere, often it will reset what mode you are on, stop, beep (turn off the vacuum for a moment) but keep moving and miss your desired area. Also it constantly gets stuck on corners of carpets (I have wood floors with carpets). Today the final stray, it got stuck on a corner of my carpet at my back door, and the rubber wheels "eat" into the rug for maybe 10 minutes before I noticed it and pulled out most of the fibers in my wool rug. GONE! I have had a gen 2 roomba, this is better, but no where as good as the more expensive models from other companies. Its not dependable enough to let it run each day, as you will come home and it would have been stuck.

R353:	One star for the product, 5 stars for customer support. I'm so bummed that this product doesn't work long because when it does work, it works great. I even suggested a few friends get this product (sorry, friends). I use this RoboVac in about 500 square feet with laminate flooring and a few small rugs. I did not get this small vacuum to take the place of a more powerful upright vacuum, but I used it a few times a week to help control the amount of god hair in my house. However, in my experience, they only last a few months. I purchased my first RoboVac in October of last year, then in February, the unit stopped working. The power button would turn red and it would beep two times indicating that the side brushes were stuck. I tried cleaning the entire unit and replaced the brushes, but it still wouldn't clean. I contacted customer support, and the next week I had a new RoboVac. Well, here I am just 4 months later and I am having the same problem. I once again contacted consumer support and they sent me a return label so that I can receive a refund. Hopefully that goes through. Maybe it's just bad luck to run into the same problem twice, but it's enough to look at other options. I would be hesitant to purchase from them again, and I hope that they can work on these kinks so that their products last longer.

R355:	It is definitely more finicky than my Roomba 595. I could have never imagined our carpet was too thick/long to cause this vacuum issues but it simply cannot handle it. Thankfully, the carpeted area is very limited but, without a doubt, it hangs up and cannot complete its cycle. GOOD: 1) Setup is easy 2) It's very quiet 3) Does well on hardwoods 4) Hit sensors do a much better job than my Roomba so it doesn't bang into as much furniture. BAD: 1) The scheduling seems off. I've got it set for 1:00 a.m. but I'll see it start later in the afternoon (I've verified the clock is correct) [Update: 4/27 - This has been corrected]. 2) Just won't work on carpet. I would classify my carpet as 'decent.' It is essentially one or two steps above builders grade. Update 4/27: We ended up moving this to a floor with no carpet and it works really well. It has great suction and is easy to clean. If you have only hardwoods, I definitely would recommend. I still could not recommend if you have carpet. Another note: Eufy Support is top notch. I have no qualms about ordering anything from them in the future. Great company.

R361:	The eufy 11 was affordable enough for us to discover that robo vacs are great for keeping the floors tidy with little effort. Unfortunately this little vac has not been very durable. They work well at not running into obstacles for about 3 months and then just start plowing into everything. The support over the phone was fast and easy. The first time I called I was emailed a return shipping label and sent a replacement "it was clearly a used unit". The second time I received a full refund! So overall the customer service was 5 stars but the product is just not durable. I'm now looking to find a replacement that will last much longer.

I talked to Eufy customer service to try to resolve the problem but the fixes they suggested didn't help and they told me to return the product to Amazon. When I did, I wasn't able to get a replacement, just a refund, and the price has gone up by $30 since my original order. I won't be getting another one. Update: Great response from Eufy customer service to my review. They sent me a new RoboVac to try out. It's working a lot better than the first one.

R369:	This is a solid 3 star because it largely performs its vacuuming well and is a great deal for the price. I have a dog that really sheds which means I would have hair on the floor and dust bunnies within a week, and this definitely prevents that and keeps the floor nice and clean. It loses points because the main reason someone is buying a robotic vacuum is to let it clean automatically, and this device can't really do that. First, it needs alexa or an app integration. You're at work, you decide that tonight you're hosting for the game, but you have no way to order the vacuum to vacuum. That's kind of unforgivable for a robotic vacuum, you know? It comes with a standard IR remote, but there's no way to non-locally order a cleaning. It either needs to be pre-scheduled or there is none. Eufy, if you're listening, I highly recommend an app and alexa for the next version. Second, unlike some other vacs there is no way to prevent it from vacuuming an area without physically blocking it off, which means any exposed wire could get swept up (and the suction is indeed good) and tugged along and if you have deeper carpets (as I do for a welcome/entry mat) it can't handle them and will get stuck. This means you can't really schedule a cleaning, you either have to run it when you happen to be in the room so you can keep an eye (or an ear, listening for it getting stuck) out for it, or you have to "prep" the vacuuming area by removing/blocking the problem areas. I do not use the scheduling functionality because I need to roll my welcome mat before turning the vacuum on. That should not have to happen. Great vacuum, falls short in the automation realm. Good value for price. 3 stars.

	S10:	Second, unlike some other vacs there is no way to prevent it from vacuuming an area without physically blocking it off, which means any exposed wire could get swept up (and the suction is indeed good) and tugged along and if you have deeper carpets (as I do for a welcome/entry mat) it can't handle them and will get stuck.

R370:	My Robovac 11 worked fine for about 2 months. Good, not great but what do you expect for the price? Then all of a sudden I started getting errors. Originally it was an error on the suction fan; fixed than and immediately an error with the rolling brush. I have thoroughly cleaned the entire product and switched out all of the brushes possible but I still can't even get the thing to turn on. One of the main reasons I purchased this was for the glowing customer service reviews of Eufy. Eufy has been completely unresponsive except for a canned reply that they got my email and would respond in a day or two - that was four days ago. Very disappointed in the customer service - don't waste your time or money with Eufy / Anker products.

R371:	I've owned a couple of Roombas so my review compares the Eufy to previous experience these devices. The good: Eufy has great suction - Better than my previous Roombas and cleans well. It manages to traverse area carpets well. It's much, much quieter than the Roombas as well. The bad: Eufy's logic is lacking in comparison to a Roomba and this results in the unit getting stuck in places it simply shouldn't get stuck. It has difficulty with chairs and will enter under a chair and be unable to exit. This morning, it got stuck under a chair that has openings of 14" and 15". A Roomba simply pivots around a chair leg to exit. It also became confused under a chair with a closed back. The opening in the front is over 21", so I'm unable to explain why the unit became confused and gave up underneath it. It also became stuck between a toilet and the wall in the master bathroom. It just kept banging into the wall and the toilet. The vac needs to be smart enough not to enter areas so tight it can't exit. I've seen reviews and answers to questions regarding its ability to deal with rugs that have fringe. We have a dining room carpet with 4" fringe and Eufy became stuck on it multiple times. We also noticed that it managed to pull out some of the fringe damaging the carpet. This is obviously unacceptable. This unit does not have any kind of virtual wall available to restrict it from an area, so there is no way to make it avoid the carpet. The number of times Eufy becomes stuck is variable, but its current record is 7. If I have to chase the vac around restarting it continually, it defeats the purpose of the device and I might as well get my Dyson out and vacuum. I really want to like this little vac, but its limitations are aggravating and he may be returning to the manufacturer.

It does fine in the kitchen, but it won't run for more than 5 minutes in our living room before it gets stuck. Sometimes it will stop in the middle of the floor and just start beeping (and our carpet is not tall, either). This thing just sucks, and NOT in a good way.

R381:	Pros: Works well on hardwood/linoleum. Is quiet, and has a long-lasting battery. Cons: Gets stuck on a throw rug on my living room - usually within 5 minutes of starting it. It uses a 'turning' behavior while on the rug that does not turn it, and eventually gives up. (thinking,, no doubt, that it surrounded by something it can't turn away from) The device can, however, easily spin in place; it just can't jerk itself successfully in a new direction. (the same turning routine it uses to follow a wall) I've written the company about this. I'll update based on their response.

R387:	The one I got would only run for 30 minutes on a full 24-hour charge. That could be a manufacturing defect and it's not the end-of-the-world. Where it cleaned, it seemed to do a good job, it's fairly quiet and seems to be solidly built. The other problem is that the fall avoidance algorithm can't be turned off. Why not? Not every house/room has stairs. The result is that in a room that has dark rugs, it gets to the edge of the rug and thinks it is seeing a potential fall and retreats. Which means that some areas of the floor get cleaned endlessly while the rugs get nothing. Eufy, don't let programming teams make decisions like this, they have tunnel vision. You need real people in real houses to evaluate your product and recommend design changes. Any step or stairway can be easily blocked, but if I have to pick up my rugs, I don't want your product. If it had cleaned properly, I would have exchanged it for another one, because overall, I think it is as good as a Roomba, maybe better.

R390:	So having 3 dogs and 2 cats in a 800 sqft home tends to bring about a lot of floating hair and over time a smell associated with having animals in your home. Finding constantly annoyed with the need to vacuum almost every day I decided to give the Eufy a try. I also had a refurbished Neato XV in the past and it was fantastic. Unfortunately one of the cat decided to pee on it and it ruined the Neato and made it smell beyond fixing.... Pros: -Great Battery life. Gets about 1.5 hours of run time before needed to be charged. -The holding bin is of the largest size you can currently get for these RoboVac -It has plenty of suction power and pics up hair stuck in the carpet you will generally not even notice. Plus floating hair balls have been cut down to almost not existent. -The filter is very good it is much easier to clean then my Neato XV was. -It operation is fairly quite compare to the Neato that I previously had. -The build quality is nice. -short height allowing it to fut under low standing furniture. -The controller is nice but I never used it other then to set the Eufy up for the first time -Easy to disassemble for cleaning on a bi-weekly basis. Cons: -It gets stuck constantly. Vents in floor, in corners, forcing its self under furniture. Luckily it is easy to restart with your foot by pushing the big power button on top. The beeping noises it makes are not too annoying when stuck. -The sensors do get covered up quite easily with hair and will cause it to just stop in the middle of the room. This should be fixed. -It has almost no intelligent cleaning pattern, bouncing off walls to figure its way around the house. -Not very good at cleaning wall edges. Get luckly that it blows hair off the edge of the wall so it can collect it later... Comparing this to the Neato I had. I really miss the Neato. It was easy to predict that the Neato would clean the whole house roughly the same way every time with very little assistant needed. I can't afford a new Neato and this was a great deal at the time for $175. At that price I would recommend the Eufy but I would recommend the Neato any day over the Eufy at the same price. Hope this helps.

R391:	I've been waiting several years to buy a robot vacuum, but was always underwhelmed by performance and price. When the New York Times reported that the relatively inexpensive Eufy had bested Roomba, I bought one at once. Sadly, it's clunky junk in my home. Others have cited its blinding weaknesses, so I will be brief in recounting them again. It gets hung up with regularity, and on the most mundane "obstacles." It cannot cross even the lowest thresholds. It refused to cross from my very thin carpeting (Flor system carpet tiles) to the hardwood floors. It acted like it was on the edge of a precipice. I expect it was because my floors and rugs are all dark. It never seemed to learn anything in its wanderings, even when I gently nudged it across thresholds or extricated it from its constant alarm conditions. Add to all this that it didn't pick up all that much. Terribly disappointed with this dud. Not worth the trouble at any price. June 21, 2017 addendum: To their credit, the Eufy folks expressed concern about my unmet expectations and asked if they could send me a free Eufy. I thought that odd as, even free, the product wouldn't do the job. But, who turns down free? What arrived surprised me. Instead of a robot cacuum, they sent a rechargeable upright vacuum. I already have a great upright vacuum by a well-known English maker of vacuums; hence my interest in a robot vacuum. "Great," I thought, "ANOTHER vacuum to store or give away." But, I tried it, and I have to say, it's great and so handy. Small, lightweight and cordless, it feels almost like a toy, but--and I say this as praise--it really sucks. It makes short work of picking up the crumps, dust, sand and debris of daily foot traffic. It's small enough to fit behind my bedroom door. It's a great little vacuum. Perfect for an apartment dweller and for light-duty cleanup. It doesn't change a thing in terms of the failures of the robot version, but it certainly makes me admire Eufy's customer care. Thanks for the great gift, Eufy!

R402:	I have mixed feelings about this robovac... I read about its prowess on my local paper column where the focus is "quality" frugal living ; everything sounded wonderful, especially its ability and price. I ordered it the same day I read the column. I was excited to operate it! The instructions were clear and the start-up easy. I was pleased... I put it to work. I then followed it throughout my house as it went over rugs, bamboo flooring and tile for a loooong time. It seemed to repeatedly miss some of the SMALL debris in various areas. I was NOT happy with the outcome. I then chose to return it immediately. My mixed feelings arose when I was repacking it for the return process. I was surprised at the amount of debris and dust that had collected in the canister. Maybe I should have given it more time...

I have followed all the troubleshooting instructions but to no avail. I don't have the tolerance for things like this at this at this stage in my life so I have no idea how the company's customer service is because I didn't bother trying it's inexcusable for a product that I have literally had for 5 days to just completely stop working. So instead I requested a refunded from Amazon, chalked it up as a lesson learned and am done with it. I ordered a Roomba, I recommend you buy any other Robovac but this.

I contacted customer service and told them of my issues, they were no help at all and told me to send them a video of the vacuum cleaner so they could 'troubleshoot' it. I don't know why a video is required when I could perfectly describe it, it seemed they just didn't want to help at all. It 'worked' for a while (although continued to quit in the middle of a cleaning cycle for no apparent reason, sometimes after vacuuming for less than 10 minutes) then ultimately just stopped working altogether. I contacted customer service again and no reply. I'm now working directly with Amazon to get a refund. I suggest BUYER BEWARE on this and perhaps choose a robot vacuum with better customer service.

R423:	Eufy has descent suction, but I can't give it more than 3 starts. One reason is that I got it in November and it's just July and the thing's making weird noises. Also, it comes on at all hours of the day and starts cleaning. Kind of freaks you out. Eufy is very good at getting around. We have a very thick area rug and he gets up there quite easily. BUT: He has no plan of action. He's a lot like a puppy that's been let loose in a new house. He's all over the place. Goes straight, then smells something and darts off, but before he gets there. Crazy. One good function is that it goes around the walls/edges well. I've only had him for 7 months and he is already making weird noises.

R424:	Ive had this vacuum for a year now. I replaced a Rollibot vacuum when my husband broke it by snapping one of the side sweepers (thanks, hun) So I have some basis for comparison. Pros: Low profile. Can even get under the couches (barely) which is great so long as it finds its way back out again Large waste bin. Only ever need to dump it out once its done. Long battery life. Lasts hours. Cons: Cant handle pet hair. In addition to the sweepers theres a middle brush similar to a regular vacuum. This sucks (in the wrong way) for pet hair. It constantly needs to be cleaned out and pet hair gets trapped in the space between the brush and the bin. That big bin size I mentioned earlier? Useless because when clogged nothing makes it in there anyway. This machine has degraded fast. Now when I run it, it will constantly stop in the middle of the floor and beep like there's an issue. Best i can tell is its due to the hair clogging it. But even cleaning it out ends up giving me just a few minutes before I have to rescue it again. The point of these things is to let them run while you do something else. Instead i have to go press the button every minute or so just to get it to keep moving. It got to the point where sweeping manually was faster and less stressful. I'm finding myself really missing my Rollibot.

R426:	If you do not want cleaning to occur on a daily schedule/timer, then this will be a great vacuum for you. There is however issues with the scheduled cleaning function and it does not work after a period of time. For the first several months of using it I had no issues. I scheduled cleaning everyday at 8am. Then it started coming on later and later, almost like the clock was off. I verified it was not, then it started cleaning at 3am when it was set for 8am. Then it stopped cleaning all together. I could still manually start it and it would clean no problem. Problem is, I bought it to automatically clean every day, not to manually clean when I remembered to push the button. I will say the customer service is great! I emailed Eufy with my proof of purchase and within a few days I had a replacement item in route to me and they told me to keep my existing unit. The replacement unit worked well, but after a few weeks it was having the same problem with scheduled cleaning. I contacted Eufy again and they are going to issue a refund. Again, their customer service was great but the vacuum obviously has a bug that prevents scheduled cleaning from occurring over time. I am told their newer models don't have this issue, but I cannot verify that personally. The function of the vacuum is great, it works well and other than getting stuck a few times under a baby gate and on a big bath mat, it cleans very well. You cannot schedule daily cleanings reliability, so that is the only issue, but it is a major one for me.

R427:	Well I loved this little robo vac for the first 3 months. Just after the warranty expired it died. One of the front brushes stopped working, which made the entire machine stop. I did all I could (replaced the brush, cleaned the machine, etc.). I contacted customer support and they were willing to replace the machine. Great! Except they didn't have the same model and what I got instead was some lesser Eufy - which, frankly, is terrible. Whatever programming it has causes it to get stuck repeatedly where the first could successfully navigate, shorter battery life (likely because it is refurbished), and lastly it has little suction. So, while the first did a great job of sucking up pet hair (the number one reason for my purchase) the new one leaves it all behind. Basically I am back to just using my regular vacuum with the added pleasure of fishing the stupid Eufy out from wherever it got stuck overnight. So disappointed because this was an extremely expensive purchase and I got only 3 months use out of it. Sadly can't recommend.

R428:	I really loved this vaccume but for it to stop working after the 14 month mark is ridiculous for the price. The brush motor stopped working and I contacted Customer Service to get a brush motor ordered and they told me they don't make replacement parts and refused to do anything for me. For a $200 vaccume to stop working after a year and to not offer replacement parts is a joke! They literally told me to search online to try and find someone selling an old one for parts instead of trying to help me! Terrible customer service!!!!!!

R430:	Update to the previous review below, I have to give eufy credit and perhaps an extra star for the 11 for the response. The 11 itself is not a product for everyone I have found and they were quick to suggest giving the 30 a try. In retrospect I wish I had reached that conclusion from the start. The boundary strip feature found in the 30 turned out to be critical to making the experience effective. I gave up the hepa filter but I wasn't too concerned about that. I left a more detailed review of the 30 but the one bit of credit I will give is for eufy's efforts to track customer satisfaction. They do a remarkable job on follow-ups and seem genuinely interested in their customer's satisfaction. So again, the 11 wasn't the product for me but if you have a normal every day floor with no silliness going on or unusual changes in height/material it will likely get the job done. Best of luck! Pictured is the transition that causes us the most trouble. Overall this little device has worked 'alright'. It's been ok. Not impressive and at times annoying. It manages most bumps and challenges like carpet transitions well, but it gets stuck on other things like an errant flip flop or extension cord. It has a major problem with the door to our porch which has a small transition lip on the floor. It goes up the lip, hits the door, backs down, goes forward and up the lip, hits the door, goes down... makes a god awful racket in the process. "Buh dunk, buh dunk, buh dunk, buh dunk" for about 5 minutes before it moves on on its own or is told to go elsewhere. It doesn't handle pet hair well at all. It picks it up but I also have to pick it out of the brush regularly. All and all cleaning is acceptable but I guess I had hoped for more out of a modern "robot" vacuum.

R431:	I bought this product about a year and a half ago, because it was a great deal and seemed to have decent reviews. It worked well for awhile then it started making strange noises, would continuously get stuck in the same spot over and over in one cleaning cycle. Then a few weeks ago the suction quit working. After reading that these vacuums aren’t able to be repaired I began looking for a new one and found a top of the line Roomba on sale for a price similar to this one. The Roomba makes this machine look bad. Not only does the Roomba map and remember your house so that it won’t get stuck constantly, they are covered by better warranties and easily repairable making them a much better investment. Don’t waste your money on this machine you will eventually regret it.

When I called the company I was told it was either a warnings near a ledge (on the ground floor so that wasn’t the cause) or I internally something was wrong. They can’t suggest any repairs as they only replace. BUYER BEWARE as after a year you are out of luck. Anything that I spending a couple of hundred on...and maintain well I expect to last longer.

R433:	I bought a eufy vac to replace a Roomba that got involved with too many poopageddons to be useful. The eufy vac NEVER completed a circuit of my first floor, I had to pick it up, retrieve it, relocate it every single day. The suction was good, the battery life seemed ok, it got stuck against flat surfaces (counter to floor interface) and rugs constantly. Talked to customer service multiple times, completely unhelpful, sent them a video of the product revving in neutral in an unobstructed area (base of a counter in the middle of open kitchen), no help. I eventually returned it with no acknowledgement, no refund, no coupon, no feedback. Then Amazon wouldn't let me review the POS for a very long time, I'm assuming because there are a lot of negative reviews of the product. I got in touch with Amazon re: inability to review a product I paid a couple of hundred dollars for, and eventually was able to do so. I would definitely not recomment this. Went back to a Roomba, higher price model, love it, well worth the money for a large house with two dogs and two cats. In this case, got less than I paid for when it came to eufy.

R434:	We had our robovac 11 for a little over a year when it died, it has been a fantastic little helper picking up a shocking amount of dirt and dog hair every time. Unfortunately we noticed that it wasn't quite running straight anymore even after double checking all the mechanical parts were clean. Now we cant seem to get more than 2 minutes out of a charge. I gave it 3 stars because it was great while it lasted and I've even bought 2 more eufy vacuums for both of my sisters. Would I buy it again? I'm not sure, it was such a great vacuum to have but only 1 year for a $200 vacuum doesn't seem like great value.

R435:	I have had this vacuum, who we've lovingly nicknamed Eufy, for about 6 months now and have really gotten to know it. I have to say it's just okay. For us, it cannot really serve as the only way to vacuum our floors. It is better than nothing, but nowhere near as thorough as an upright vacuum that you push yourself. What we do is-- a thorough vacuum with an upright every two weeks and then run Eufy in between to help things not get too out of hand. But as I said, it doesn't do a thorough job. The other reason that I only give it 3 stars is because it gets stuck in a lot of places, so someone actually needs to be home when it's running-- it woudn't work for us to just turn it on before we leave the house -- we would for sure come home to Eufy stuck somewhere. My kids are becoming pros at going to "rescue" Eufy when they hear the familiar beep indicating that it is stuck, and we often have to go on "Eufy hunts" when we notice it hasn't returned to the home base and is stuck somewhere. I didn't expect to need this amount of effort and attention for a robot vac. But it is better than noting for us.

R436:	At first I was really excited and happy but she (We named her Pancha) only will clean 40 minutes fully charged and never returns to her base before dying so I have to search for her if i don't follow her around which defeats the purpose. I am very upset since I wanted a second one from my second floor since my house is kind of big (3590sf) so I was not expecting for one to do the whole house but at least the bottom floor. My house is empty right now since we bought it repo and they just finished the remodel so I am afraid l it will die even faster once she has to go around furniture. I waited to use her because of the rebuild so i am not trying to send it back but i will need to buy two other brands for the rest of my house ;( I loved how she looks and how quiet she is. I really wanted her to last.

R437:	I recently purchased the Eufy RoboVac 11. It worked well for the first week or so. I had it scheduled to run every day at noon. Unforunately, I came home today and the vacuum had knocked off a piece of plastic, got caught in the vacuum, and severely scratched my wood floors around the room. It's pretty severe damage and I don't understand why there wasn't a safety mechanism in place to prevent the vacuum from running when it was obviously clogged with a large plastic item with enough resistance to dig into wood floors.

R438:	While not the same machine my only point of comparison is the iRobot Braava. I prefer the Braava. My biggest complaint is how easily the Eufy gets stuck. I've found it stuck on a floor board, on a heating grate, and a door sil, and on power cords. It's supposed to have all these fancy sensors but it seems to find a way to get stuck. The other strange thing is the amount of recommended room that the instructions want for placing the charger: it wants 36 foot square space blank space against a wall; six feet along a way and six feet out from the wall. That's a small room just for this thing to sit and charge. On the other hand, I was stunned when I emptied out the bin and found it full of debris. Who knew?! It does vacuum up a tremendous amount of dust. The Braava hardly ever got stuck. I could stick a dry swiffer cloth on it for dust and a wet siffer cloth for mopping and it would just go! However, it was not a vacuum so it couldn't do my area rugs.

R439:	I’ve had and used this vacuum for over a year, and it has made me clean and sweep the floor more than when I never had it. Reasons why you should just buy something else: 1. This vacuum does not clean the whole area, just one spot, wherever it wants really. No rhyme or reason why it goes where it goes. 2. It’s a PLANT BULLY. I have several plants in my home, some on the floor and some on plant stands. This vacuum will run into my plants over and over until they topple over and spill soil all over the place, then attempt to clean the soil, but instead spreads the soil all over the house. 3. If you forget and let it run too long it will remain where the battery died and you will have to bring it and manually insert it into the charging dock. 4. It likes to eat bathroom rugs. 5. It doesn’t always know how to find its way home to its charging dock. I’ve advised all my friends to invest in a better vacuum, not something like this, and now I’m telling you. Trust me, it’s worth it, in the long run.

R440:	Would have loved to give this more stars, but it's just not a reliable product and anker/eufy doesn't even make this model anymore, so no support. It worked well for about 5 months, then things started going downhill fast. Keep in mind, that I cleaned it regularly, removed hair and lint from the roller, replaced the side brushes regularly, etc...but it just isn't built well. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks to get a reliable unit.

R441:	Okay, don't know if I will show as verified, as I purchased on eBay from Ankerdirect to get 10% off. Received eufy with quick shipping from local outlet fulfilled by Amazon. I charged, flipped over to install the side brushes, and WHOH!, the main brush was full of crap and hairs!!! (see photo). USED! Should NEVER happen, ever! STRIKE ONE Emailed eufy and they quickly agreed to send RMA and issue a replacement. I made sure to ask for a NEW PRODUCT, NOT USED! They issued the RMA and I repacked into the Amazon mailer and when I tried to mail it there was insufficient postage!!! STRIKE TWO Went home, reprinted RMA, tossed one box and had to re-mail. GRRR. Replacement robovac shipped from Kentucky and took longer (BUT, USPS delivered on a Sunday!!) Maiden voyage: ziggged and zagged around, got stuck once (might have got unstuck if I waited), limped and found its base when tired. Did a good job and wife happy. We are waiting for the appropriate name to strike us for our new toy. So far, very happy with performance. Will update when tested further and change stars if it keeps up the good work. For Anker: 1. When the robovac needs to charge, have it cease the vacuuming function so it has plenty of power to get home. 2. Have a "full dust bin" warning or stop vacuuming and go home. We had a clean home, just vacuumed, but it still over-filled up in one session.

R442:	UPDATE: May 2020: I had it replaced and the new one lasted about as long as the first one! Less than a year! It gets “stuck on NOTHING, it can’t find its own way to the charging station and some days it blows debris everywhere vs sucking it up. DO NOT BUY! She’ll our for a real Roomba! This thing was amazing while it lasted! Out of nowhere, it started just going in jerky circles in the same spot before beeping that something was wrong. Naturally, this was outside of the return time period. I can’t find any kind of trouble shooting to fix the issue. I keep it clean, the sensors are clear. I’m really disappointed. Consider shelling the money out for a REAL roomba. This thing should have lasted much longer than it did.

R444:	I've had eufy since June-ish of 2018. He was great at first! We have two cats and he cleaned up the cat hair off the floor like a dream. Whenever my boyfriend would drop crumbs on the ground, he would send for eufy to clean it up. Lately, though, all eufy does is bump into everything. It seems like the suction power has decreased significantly and I clean him out religiously. I've tried changing the filter, and that helped a little bit but not nearly well enough. I find that I have to run him through the house more than once to make sure he gets everything.

R445:	It works, but it is by no means perfect. After a month my original one suddenly stopped recognizing objects and walls, and despite cleaning all of the sensors, was slamming in to things. Thankfully the company was kind enough to send me a replacement after trying to troubleshoot the original with me. Having had a functional one for two months now I can say it's a fine vacuum, but it's not great at picking up larger pieces of dirt. My boyfriend tracked some dried mud into our house and the Eufy was not able to pick up a dime sized piece off of the hardwood floor. I also wish I didn't have to clean the sensors as often as I do to keep it from banging in to stuff, though this one works better than my first one it's still got white scuff marks on the bumper from colliding with walls. I also see it sometimes blowing or pushing dust and debris out of the way, i.e. the brushes sometimes just propel dust forward. It drives me a little crazy how often it gets stuck under my couch, and I know the manual says to set up a barrier to keep it from going under, but it seems like it would be a lot easier for them to provide some kind of virtual wall like the Roomba has.

R446:	Buy this if you want to buy another one in 13 months. The one year warranty expired and on the 13th month it stopped working. I called customer support and they tried to sell me a "better model". With the planet struggling with disposable products and mountains of trash don't bother with Eufy. They are into "planned obsolescence" and it is set like clockwork to expire right after their warranty period ends. *Shameful* that companies are still cranking out products for the garbage heap/ landfill.

R447:	This was our first robotic vacuum and after hours of research we decided on the Eufy 11. I must say I was amazed at how well it worked! Well fast forward 6 months and we started having all sorts of random issues. It started working half the time and would constantly give us random warnings most of which didn’t appear to be accurate. We changed all parts multiple times and we were still not getting good results. It seems like the Efuy replacement parts ar not exactly the same and don’t work well. We continued to still use it with it only working half the time. Fast forward another 6 months and now this thing is so loud and obnoxious it is unbearable to us. At this point if we do run it when we leave it really doesn’t pick up anything and it’s basically a waste of time. My wife wants a new one and I’m not happy about having to buy a new one just a year later. I decided to look back to see exactly how long I’ve had it because I figured they had some sort of warranty and I have read good things about there customer service. Well wouldn’t you know I’m exactly 20 days past the one year warranty, just my luck! At the end of the day these are priced decent compared to some of the competition but if you have to replace every year it might be better to buy a more expensive one that last longer. Hopefully Efuy works out the issues with there vacuums because it was such an amazing product at first.

R448:	I bought this because of the amazing reviews and because it was on sale for Prime day. I have been wanting to invest in a vaccum like this for a while and felt like this was a good deal. This literally does not pick up a single crumb on the floor. It passes up everything on the floor and will completely run over a crumb but not pick it up. I do more in two minutes with my Dyson than this does in an hour. So completely disappointed. Do not waste your money!!!!!

R449:	When it runs, the Eufy is awesome. It is quieter than a Roomba (which we now have), cheaper, and has a larger bin. However, we couldn't keep our Eufy working. After about a month, our first Eufy stopped working and kept giving us the "side brush stuck stuck" signal. However, the side brushes were perfectly clean. We called Anker and they sent us a new one. The second one lasted a week before it started having the same problem. We completely broke it down and still couldn't find any debris that would affect the side brushes. We finally got our money back from Anker and bought a Roomba 690. Despite the high ratings, be aware that this problem is quite common and there is no fix.

However, after 6 months of using it the roller brush error would go off 2 minutes into turning it on. We cleaned the entire bottom part out multiple times (no tacks, nails, etc), and finally ordered a new brush. It took over a month to received the replacement part and the issue is still the same. I have emailed the company and hoping they will help resolve the issues.

R452:	EDIT 9/18 - 2 stars Well "until" happened again. This time it's the motor. It makes an odd banging sound... I tried cleaning it and taking it apart as far as I was comfortable and it's definitely the motor. I'm starting to get really frustrated with this product and I'm not sure what my next step will be. EDIT 4 stars Eufy support was very quick to contact me and set up a replacement, it got here fast and so far so good. We will see where this one ends up but I am optimistic. I have it at 4 stars because of the following: 1. Hard/impossible to get replacement parts 2. not amazing for multi pet owners... it works okay but I feel like I am cleaning it every other day. 3. is in no way "smart" about how it goes about cleaning. For the price, however I wouldn't expect it to have the intelligence of a $450+ robot vac... I don't think I can recommend this as a "use instead of a real vacuum," but it is perfectly fine for "keeps it relatively clean and then real vac less often." Hopefully this one lasts me. ORIGINAL REVIEW 2 Stars I had the Anker Robovac 10 for a while... and it was great... UNTIL the software started messing up and the robot would just run back and forth in a small space, no discernable cleaning whatsoever... Anker support, which had changed over to Eufy at the time was great about it and sent me the RoboVac 11 as a replacement. That was very nice of them and it was great... UNTIL the RoboVac 11 started to give the 4 red beeps of "Roller brush stuck" I took the brush off, cleaned it, tried cleaning any mechanism in the brush holder and nothing. it just wouldn't move anymore. I'm getting quite frustrated at the perceived and realized lack of quality in these RoboVacs.

R453:	My boyfriend bought me this as a housewarming gift only a couple months ago, and I was immediately impressed with the product. Everyday it ran its scheduled cleaning and got through my entire condo (hardwood floors, a few area rugs) no problem. I have 2 cats and it didn't have a problem picking up the hair. I routinely cleaned it and charged it, etc, but now when it turns on, it only goes in circles. I have tried cleaning it again, removing any and all debris, as well as dusting all the sensors, making sure it is charged- but it won't do anything different beyond going in continuous circles. Taking it apart will void the warranty so I am not inclined to do that. It sucks because it was a great product until now.

R454:	This was Consumer Reports 2nd highest rated vacuum. So far, I'm not impressed. It may work great for small homes, but not larger floor plans. I would say total of 1500 sq ft because although it returns to the base for recharging, it doesn't start up again to finish cleaning where it left off. If you have a Labrador or Golden Retriever, you will be required to spend lots of time vacuuming yourself if you dont want to see dog hair in the majority of main living areas in your home. Especially if you have hardwood floors throughout. There is no rhyme or reason to its cleaning method and it just goes in whatever direction most of the time leaving many large areas untouched. Very disappointed!!

R455:	The Eufy doesn't really do a good job of picking up all the scraps on the floor. It does a random search across the floor and you can only be hopeful that it sweeps everything. The bigger issue is that the battery life is absolutely terrible. I originally had issues with this battery within 9 months of purchase. I reached out to the manufacturer, and they provided me with an alternate battery. However, another 9 months later, I am finding that the Eufy battery is having the exact same issue. Given this is out of warranty, I have no hope of finding a resolution for this. This will prob serve as paper weight moving forward....

R457:	I wanted to love this vacuum so, so badly. After all, it came highly-reviewed for its price point, and in particular the main thing I needed it to do -- judiciously pick up loads of cat hair off a wood floor -- seemed to be one of its strong suits. Unfortunately, at least in my case, this has proven frustratingly untrue. While it seems mediocre to halfway decent at general vacuuming, I cant imagine a less efficient or effective robot when it comes to picking up pet hair on my hardwood floors, as it seems to prefer to just shoot the hairs out or spread them around vast stretches of my apartment, resulting in lengthy skid marks of compressed pet hair which I have to then pick up when the robot finally and mercifully turns off for the day. Finally, I would also mention that, while I knew I wasn't purchasing a particularly "smart" robot, I certainly didn't expect it to be this dumb. I absolutely cannot run the thing without close supervision, because it seems to obsessively return to the same spot in my living room dozens of times during its daily run cycle; a spot which has three metal-legged dining table chairs. It climbs these legs incessantly and gets stuck on them, resulting in me having to physically move the stupid thing across my apartment and restart it...20+ times a day. 30 seconds later, its back on the legs again. It seems almost as if I've paid 260 dollars for a drunk toddler to clean my apartment once a day, which is particularly maddening. I would certainly not buy this vacuum again, and I will avoid Eufy in the future.

R460:	I bought this Vac a year ago today on prime day. I loved it at first! It absolutely changed my life! Throughout the year I have had some random problems with it that always seemed to resolve but last week it suddenly failed. It would run for a minute then stop and beep 4 times. We researched the issue and followed all of the troubleshooting tips from Eufy and others and none of them worked unfortunately. So I'm now going to have to buy another robovac because this thing has made life so much easier cleaning up after a 4 year old.

R461:	i'd give it 5 stars if they would fix the scheduling on the iPhone app. These are great robotic-vacs, and also a great value. However, about 2 months ago, Eufy broke the scheduling feature on the iPhone app, rendering it useless. So if you are a "set it and forget it" type like me, this makes these things almost unusable. I have called Eufy support 3 separate times and have been told they are aware of the problem. And to date, they have not fixed it.

R462:	I purchased this on prime day and had high hopes bc of all of the positive reviews. It's running now for the first time and I'm not happy with my purchase. I do like that it's quiet but so far that's the only thing that I like. I HATE that it is just randomly moving throughout my house. It does not move in any sort of pattern and does not complete a room before moving onto the next one. I've tried a few different settings and none of them change that. We also watched the brushes sweep some small debris AWAY from the vacuum instead of sucking it up. I'm hoping to be able to return the product as I'm very unsatisfied with my purchase.

R463:	I’ve had this vacuum for 14 months and it conveniently tears up right outside of the warranty window. I email Eufy support who did nothing aside from offer me a discount on a new one or the suggestion I purchase a refurbished one. I inquired about purchasing a part that would fix the issue, but they said they didn’t have any parts. I’m curious about their refurbished vacuums if they don’t have parts. How do they refurbish them without parts? After searching online, it seems as though these usually do tear up right after your warranty is out. The vacuum did well enough, but was constantly getting stuck on different things that were well within the constraints of eufy’s suggested dimensions.

R464:	Started really well, then i fell victim to the dog poo spread.....I took the vacuum apart and cleaned with a toothbrush, i was very careful to put everything back as i had it, but now it gives me 3 bleeps after it's charged for all of 10 minutes to notify me that the bumper is stuck - I have no idea why, because the bumper isn't stuck. I guess long and short of it is, don't take it apart, because it's quite delicate inside the machine. When it works though, it's a dream. I'm going to upgrade to one of the newer ones now, and maybe let this one keep bleeping itself to death upstairs in my room

I don't have shag carpet but I do have area rugs and that seemed to be the challenge. I bought this because it advertised that it picks up pet hair. I'm convinced it could fill it's cup if only it could complete it's mission. The concept is awesome and I will likely request a different one for Mother's Day from the family.

R466:	I bought eufy in July of 2018 as of two months ago eufy is just sitting on his charging base not being used... why?!? Because he won’t charge! I’m not sure what’s going on we didn’t use him excessively, maybe a few times during the week but that’s it. I figured it would work a little longer than a year but I guess not. I should have bought another brand, I thought he would be better than bob sweep... nope =(. He started off strong then broke down..

R467:	I bought this Eufy with high hopes of helping minimize my housework after the birth of my third child... At first, I was so pleased! It ran every day and cut my sweeping/mopping time down significantly! But, within a few months, it gave out. It will only run for like three minutes now before it displays its error color and refuses to work. I've read the manual and tried all the troubleshooting techniques prescribed, but it will not work. It was money wasted and I am very disappointed.

I really loved the Eufy Robovac 11 but to spend that kind of money and have it work one year not worth it. Great product but not good customer service.

Troubleshooting information the company sent me did not fix the problem. I would not recommend this vacuum if you will be using it several times a week. If it’s for use once a week or so it might last a few years.

She stops ALL THE TIME for no reason in the middle of the room, with zero obstacles or height differentials in her way. ?????

R471:	Absolutely hate this product. We already had a Neato robotic vacuum and figured we would have one for upstairs and downstairs at our house. After reading the reviews for the Eufy I decided to give it a shot. Worst decision ever. Ended up throwing the Eufy on the hardwood floor and can’t even suck crumbs off of there. Now we just bring our neato up and down the stairs so he can do both levels.

If it leaves the charging station at all (most times it won’t), it goes a few inches then turns around and goes right back to the charging dock. I’m not the type to write crazy reviews, and this unfortunately is not an exaggeration. We loved this product while it worked.

R473:	We were pretty satisfied with our Eufy up until a couple months ago. We started getting the 4 beep notification and followed all the steps online to try and fix it. It would work off and on for a few days and then stop again. Now it seems to be stopped for good... pretty disappointing. We only run it once or twice a week and don’t have a large space to clean so I’m not sure why it would be broken already. Are they made to break down right after a year? If so, I won’t be buying or recommending this brand to anyone else.

It got erratic and would roam with no purpose. I used it daily for 2 months and think it found its way back "home" to the charger twice. We finally threw the machine away today. I wanted to love this product because it was a HUGE help, but wish it had worked better. Edit: I never contacted customer service and did not give them an opportunity to correct the issue.

Ive done it all, replaced battery, replaced filter, cleaned everything and dusted off sensors. Tried all tips and tricks. We are ssssSuper bummed bc he was like a part of the family. Urg!! He was a surprise for Christmas and I was racing about him to ally friends. I even have had friends who purchased same one and are also in love. My hubby was husband of the year!

R478:	If it worked on carpet would give a higher rating. I have medium length carpet in the bedrooms and it does not work on this, luckily most of my house is vinyl flooring. Can't run it on a schedule because of carpet issue, since I can't ensure it wont get stuck Seems to have trouble finding the charging base Remote is great and nice to have timer feature Quiet and cleans well on hard floors Didn't fall down the stairs or bump into things

I clean it weekly added bumpers to make sure nothing would damage it but after about 18 months, the device doesn’t even clean anymore. NOT worth anyone’s money when the warranty only lasts 1 year and the device breaks after 18 months. It may cost more for an I-Robot but at least that’ll last twice as long and have a longer warranty

The device worked well for my purposes but after 2 years stops functioning and displays an error sign when it nears my coffee table and couch, neither of which have been changed. I tried to clean everything off including the sensors without success. I called the company and they stated there is nothing they can do.

R486:	I really like this product. However, I just sent it back as it keeps trying to jump the wall for ~30 times before it moves on for 10 minutes of normal cleaning (and then it is back to trying to jump the wall again for 30 times before moving on). Also, I was disappointed that the remote batteries never seem to last more than a month (even though I only use the remote twice a month). That being said, the product does a much better job then I would sweeping the floors, so I hope the warranty repairs fix these issues.

I replaced the side brush so many times but no success. So, instead of making rooms clean, it makes more mess for me to clean :( NOT What I expected or wanted at all. So frustrating. I even turn it off most days because I know it will only make more mess than it cleaning.

R488:	My husband purchased a Eufy when our Roomba started to flake out on us. Love how quiet it is and it does a good job on pet hair. It get stuck at the top of our stairs, but dropping a dowel across the top of the stairs before the Eufy runs overnight fixes that issue. It's worked well, but the lack of replacement parts has me about to shelve it in favor of the Roomba again. The bottom brush is getting really beat up, and none of my Google-fu is finding me a replacement- but it got me here, where I found out it's *not* available yet. That is really poor planning from the manufacturer.

R496:	This vacuum did a great job of cleaning our floors, particularly with cat hair. However, after less than 6 months, it is as if it has gone blind. It routinely crashes into things, and gets stuck in one place, acting as if it is surrounded and stuck, despite being in the middle of the floor with nothing around it. We were very happy with this product until it developed this issue. Now, it routinely misses large sections of the floor, knocks things over, and is just not working well.

It gets "stuck" on sun beam shines off the hard wood. I have to frequently reset it, it will go in spot mode on its own. It only goes about 5 minutes before beeping that something is wrong, but nothing is clogged and it has no obstructions. Takeaway for me is that just spend the extra money and get a Roomba.

R540:	I purchased a Roomba over 10 years ago and have dismissed robot vacuums until now. It was anything but smart, had terrible suction, and was relentless at cleaning one area of the living room while neglecting everywhere else. But now being blessed with kids and a larger floor plan, I started looking at robot vacuums again in hopes they have gotten smarter and more efficient. But I can’t justify spending $500+ on one so that’s how I landed on the Eufy RoboVac 11. The reviews are great, product looks good, and the specs were very promising. I also looked at the DeeBot N79 and have since tried it as well, and I’m debating on which to keep. Here’s why: We have a 1,700 square foot home and we do our best to keep random objects off the ground for a clear cleaning path. I’m very impressed with how much the RV11 picks up everyday (disgusting to think about too), and how well it navigates between hardwood, tile, and low-pile carpet. I’ve only used it with the full-auto setting and for the most part it is very thorough. I love walking into the bedrooms to see the RV11’s tracks on the carpet and seeing how much cleaner it is. It manages to navigate and bounce around the entire home with enough power to navigate back to it’s charging dock. So again overall we’re quite happy. But when I say bounce around, I mean it in the most noisy/stumbling/tripping/startling/drunken sort of way. Compared to the DeeBot N79 (which looks almost identical and can even share the same docks and remote), the RV11 acts like it’s drunk when going from room to room. The infrared sensors seem to be inferior to the N79 in that it still bumps into everything: dark colored furniture, bright colored baseboards, our feet, gray walls, etc. The Eufy RV11 is no ninja thanks to it’s clumsiness, though the unit itself is reasonably quiet. For this reason alone we are hesitant on keeping it. The Deebot N79 in comparison was $20 less at time of purchase, includes wifi, has an app that you can control the unit from, and the app also allows you to find your cleaning buddy if it gets trapped or stuck somewhere in the house. On top of this, the N79 looks sober and cautious in comparison to the RV11 as it pauses around objects and makes mini corrections around corners. To put it more into perspective, I feel comfortable letting the N79 roam the house while the kids are napping. The Eufy RoboVac 11? No way. The thought of the RV11 going down the hall knocking on walls and doors and waking up the little ones makes me want to ship it back right away or limit it’s use to times when the kids aren’t home. Unfortunate, because nap time is when things get done around here. But here’s the dilemma. Between the two, the RV11 has been superior in thoroughness and consistency. Like I mentioned earlier, the Eufy RV11 makes multiple passes in each room and barely leaves any untreated spots. And while the N79 is more meticulous around objects, it apparently suffers from attention disorder and looks like Dory as it cleans only a few spots before moving on to the next room. What’s even more frustrating is that when Dory (N79) returns to the room, it somehow manages to clean only the same spots again in slight variations and then moves on again. So would I recommend the RV11 over the N79? Yes, because it cleans well and while it could use a rehab program, it still remains functional and stumbles its way home to the charging dock. The N79 on the other hand may have the added bells and whistles with wifi, but if anything it performs just a hair better than my Roomba 10 years ago.

R541:	Issue: As of right now, there is no way to get replacement parts for the "HEPA-style" filter and side brushes, both of which will need to be replaced. This is quite disappointing, as this is easily a 5-star product which a glaring omission. Doing a google search shows there are no replacement parts for sale for the Robovac 11, short of emailing Anker and asking to buy them directly, according to Anker's support forum (although who knows at what price). This is not an acceptable way to purchase replacement consumable parts in 2017. The parts really should be for sale on Amazon. However, as I wrote earlier, the vacuum is a 5-star product and I will update my review once replacement parts are more readily available. The story of a little vacuum that could: The suction on this thing is incredible. First, I vacuumed my floors with my upright vacuum before use (just to see if this little guy really could impress), moved all cords out of the way, and then let the Eufy go to work. My first impression was, "Wow. This thing is quiet! There is no way it is collecting anything off the carpet." But a quick inspection of the collection bin after 30 minutes of operation showed an embarrassingly large amount of chihuahua fur, dirt, and other little particles. So I emptied the bin and let it resume cleaning. When I noticed that the Eufy had made its way back to the charging station, I checked the bin again. More fur and dirt! Also, there were some medication tabletes I had dropped somewhere several months earlier! I'm not a dirty person, and am still blown away that this quiet little vacuum found some potentially toxic poisons and swept them up before my dogs could get to them. Impressed, I let the Eufy recharge. This does take quite a long time, but is in no way a deal breaker. The logo on the top of the vacuum pulses when recharging and goes solid when done. When it was fully charged, I thought to myself, "I wonder what else this little guy can find." More dog fur! More dirt! It just keeps finding it. Each time I empty the bin I'm astonished. And now, my floors have never looked cleaner. I can actually lay down on the carpet and not be covered in dog fur when I stand up. Bravo. Pros: - Best value for the price - Great suction - Incredibly quiet (I bet I could use this at 2:00 am and my condo neighbors would be none the wiser) - Lots of modes to choose from on the remote control - Programable for daily operation - When battery power is low, suction turns off and the vacuum makes it way back to the charging station (mine has always made it back) - Doesn't get stuck under chairs - usually it will just flip into "edge mode" and pivot around chair legs - Doesn't bother the dogs - Drop sensors prevent it from going down stairs, but aren't too sensitive for carpet-to-hardwood transition areas Cons: - Lack of availability of replacement parts (I'm looking at you, Anker), specifically replacement HEPA filters and side brushes (my first pair are already looking shabby after about a week of use) - The option to buy a replacement dust collection bin and main roller brush would be appreciated as well - currently, I've decided to just vacuum out the HEPA filter and foam cover when they get dirty and reuse them, but this is not a long term option - the unit does come with one replacement filter/foam cover and 2 replacement brushes, but I can't see the brushes lasting a long time - Unintelligent operation - it just goes in a straight line, bumps into something, turns, goes in another random direction - (this is not a terrible issue, it's just not as smart as other vacs that get a layout of the room and vacuum in straight lines, but there's no way I'm going to pay $900 for this feature **cough cough, Roomba, cough cough** - Collision detection is terrible - It seems to avoid lightly colored objects well, but runs right into dark objects. No damage, but it is annoying though, since it keeps making its way under my entertainment center and wrecks havoc with all the cords under there. Have a plan in place for issues such as these - I was using gray foam to hide the ugly mess of cords, but the Eufy sails right into it - Charging is slow but who cares? Program the vacuum to do its thing at 5 pm every day and forget it.

R542:	Multiple update review: Great bot...for the price. All I wanted was something to suck up the dog And cat fur that was creating tumble weeds in our house, without having to pull out the big vacuum. So this is Great. But beware, it's best on hard flat surfaces. It does get stuck on most of the rugs in our house, but sharp corners are an issue for it to clean, and it doesn't seem to really have a system/method to what it's doing, it just goes (update 7/8/17: yeah it's a really dumb bot). The spot clean function and the manual function are what i use the most, because they get the exact location i want. When I'm in my office, I'll set it to auto and let it run freely but will have to come grab it every now and then when it beeps (bc it got stuck on the high pile carpet). (update 7/8/17: i know what it gets stuck on, so i just block it off by curling the rug up under itself and creating a barrier, or I'll put something in it's way like shoes or pillows). There is a home function that is suppose to call the bot back to the charger, but i swear it has no idea where "home" is ...ever😄. Update October 21, 2019 - After 2 years Eufy is no longer working. not sure what the problem is.. I tried every possible troubleshooting method and replaced parts, but it just doesn't want to charge or run. I bought another robotic vacuum (the new fancy iRobot roomba) and regret spending money on this one in the first place. But it was good while it lasted and a great starter vacuum. So, take note that you'll probably only get 2 years out of a Eufy before you need to do some extra maintenance.

R543:	My Roomba wore out its battery after 8 years, and I replaced it with this product. This one lasted about 2 months. Now whenever I turn it on it spins in a circle and then stops, beeping an error code for the front bumper malfunctioning. The manual offers all of one sentence helping fix it, instructing me to mash the bumper back and forth a bit to "dislodge" something. This didn't help, and neither did an hour of removing screws and vacuming the front bumper (with a different, functioning vacuum). Despite being of comparable price to the 8 year old Roomba, this one kept getting stuck in places I could guide the Roomba to avoid - there's no invisible walls. I ended up only using it for a couple of specific rooms and even then it failed catastrophically.

R544:	Having never owned a robovac, we couldn't pass up on a deal on this one. The price was fantastic and the reviews were overwhelmingly good. Keeping in mind we have not ever had a Roomba, our experiences and assumptions are not based on having used any other robovac. We set the thing up along a wall in our living room. Our house is a "ranch style" (long) house with kitchen then living room, then entry hall, then hallway down to the other end with doors to bedrooms, etc. So the Eufy is about in the middle of the house. Turned it on and told it to go. We observed it for about 30 minutes and we found out that it is really persistent about cleaning the kitchen and half of the living room. Over and over. We also found that it was unable to handle anything black. It's as though black is invisible to it. The Eufy would always get stuck on our black speaker stands. Try over and over and over to get through them, and would seemingly be stuck on them, but finally finds it's way off. Same with very dark wood pedestal easy chair. It's like it doesn't see it...it tried to go through it. We were trying to figure out if a robovac of this price range is smart enough to actually "map" the house or not, but it doesn't seem like it. When we tell it to go back to the dock, it acknowledges the command with a beep, but doesn't return home. Also, more than once, we find the light on top was red, and the vacuum motor was running in reduced speed mode, but no beeps and no indication why. Battery was fine. We put it back in the dock for a few minutes and told it to go clean again and it was fine. It did this 3 times. The manual doesn't say because most of the errors also have a beep sequence to them, which this did not. So, unfortunately, with the "black blindness" and the fact that it doesn't seem to clean the whole house, and the other issues we had, this might have to go back. We have no carpet in the main areas so this Eufy really shouldn't have problems, but it does when it comes to furniture and accessories that are black.

R545:	The RoboVac began having problems after less than 3 months of use. It now completely stops moving partway through any given cleaning session. I reached out to Eufy with a highly detailed written report on the problem, and they responded by giving me a soft refusal on following through with their "Long Warranty Time", unless, and ONLY IF I resort to a full video documentation of the entire cleaning process up to the point of failure. Given that I am a working professional with very limited time to myself, and that the device glitch appears to occur only after an extended period of cleaning (rather than near the beginning of a cleaning session), this is an unreasonably high burden as a condition on a warranty service request. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Edited as of 6/17/2017: Eufy has reached out and mailed me a replacement unit due to the issues with the previous one. I am giving them a tentative review adjustment to 3 stars (due to their correction in their warranty service). When I am satisfied that the new unit is functioning correctly, I may consider further review adjustments at that time.

R546:	UPDATE as of June 29: Eufy contacted me following my review below. They suggested some possible fixes and, when these didn't work, Eufy promptly refunded the purchase price. This is great customer service. Eufy explained that RoboVac 11 is an entry-level product that does NOT 'learn' the layout of your home. For the price, it's understandable that in 2017 RoboVac doesn't have sophisticated programming. Hopefully this will be remedied before long. The fact remains, as other recent reviews have shown, that Eufie can't find its way back to its base, can't maneuver on/off most carpets without getting stuck, can't figure out how to stop getting trapped under furniture. Nonetheless the vacuum does work well on wooden floors where there are few tight spaces. RoboVac didn't work for me, but given Eufy's good customer service I will be willing to try out future, more advanced models. When it works properly, RoboVac cleans the floor impressively. However it gets stuck every few minutes in or on rugs (even thin ones), tight corners, and under furniture. This happens every few minutes, requiring me to find the unit and 'free' it, defeating the purpose of an automatic cleaner. Worse, the software is rudimentary. It doesn't learn where problem areas are so it can avoid them. RoboVac does not know where 'home' is, so it has great difficulty returning to its base - mostly it doesn't make it without help. Also it starts up from the charging base on its own at random times, without being programmed to do so. Unfortunately I bought this unit just before taking an extensive trip and I didn't learn the product's shortcomings until after the 1 month Amazon return deadline had passed. Otherwise I would have sent this substandard product back. AVOID THIS PRODUCT. Don't make the same mistake I made.

R547:	Initial review: There is something wrong the automatic scheduling. I have repeatedly set the scheduled time for the RoboVac to run, and most of the time it does NOT run when scheduled. This largely defeats the purpose. I have also seen it start running randomly when it was NOT programmed to run. Extremely disappointed. Update 10-27: I'd give Eufy customer support 5+ stars if I could. They contacted me, explained why I was having the problem, and also offered an exchange or refund. Their support (Anker's generally) is exceptional. I still have mixed feelings about the Robovac 11 itself. If you turn the power switch off (almost always necessary to empty the dust bin, otherwise it tries to start running by itsefl), or if it gets stuck somewhere and runs out of power (a regular occurrence), the scheduled programming is gone. So basically I would have had to reprogram the schedule *every single day.* Not well designed in this respect. Eufy customer support arranged to send me a replacement, the newer 11+. Ironically, the very next day, the existing unit stopped working entirely. It just spun in place and went nowhere. The manual said this means the bumper is stuck and you have to free it so it can move. I did that, but to no avail. It was just plain kaput, after less than 2 months of ownership. Watching it work (when it was still actually working) was both pretty cool and maddening. It tools around, more or less randomly, but does a pretty good job cleaning up. On the other hand, it does not have programming that allows it to "learn," and it would get stuck and die in exactly the same places, day after day. Frustrating. I've also picked it up and "rescued" it when it was stuck, only to watch it immediately head right back to the same spot and get stuck again-- over and over. I'm guessing people's experience depends a lot on their space and how many places where it can get stuck, wedged under a chair or couch, etc. Update 11/4: Eufy 11+ is definitely an improvement. More power, better designed dust bin, and unlike my previous Eufy 11, it is not getting stuck constantly. So far, losing the programmed start time has not been a problem, probably because it is not getting stuck and running out of power all the time, and because you can empty the dust bin without having to turn off the power switch. Docked a star because the first unit had so many problems and because it doesn't "learn" the layout of your space and location of obstacles-- but probably the best value in a robo vac today. Update 10-2018: Final verdict, this is just more trouble than it's worth. The programmed schedule *never* seems to stay programmed, and it just seems to start a cleaning cycle at whatever random time it decides, generally at the most inconvenient time for me. I turned it OFF so wouldn't have to deal with it, and it still emits loud beeping sounds at random intervals, even when docked in its base and turned OFF. I just love getting woking up at night because it decides to beep loudly at some totally random hour, for no reason I can figure out. I generally love Anker products and support, but I would not buy this again.

R548:	UPDATE: Well, the love affair is over. After six months of light usage it is giving me an error code for the drop sensors. I have cleaned, recleaned and cleaned them again and frankly they weren't dirty in the first place as I wiped it down after each use. It has done a wonderful job and I was very happy with it, but apparently there are longevity issues and it isn't worth what it costs for such a short usage period. I would not have purchased this had I known that the life of one of these as stated by the company is only 18-24months if you are lucky and get a perfect unit. Don't purchase it, it just isn't worth the gamble on how long it will work. I have had this for a month now and I must have got a good one because it does a fantastic job. Does is have the bells and whistles of an iRobot. Nope, but I don't need room barriers or anything fancy and the price is spot on for what is does. All of my floors are a mix of tile and hardwood with only a couple of low pile rugs at doors, maybe that matters for battery life. My particular unit will run for 3-4 hours on a charge and is a very thorough little machine. Can it clean where it can't fit, of course not, but it does an excellent job for what it is and my floors have never been cleaner. Mine does get hung up on the transition trim between the tile and hardwood sometimes, but it is not the machines fault it gets caught on the trim and when it squawks for help, I move it and push the button. No biggie. My expectations for this machine are met, and having a little common sense says 'Is it perfect?' of course not, but I read the description before purchasing and knew exactly what I was and was not getting. Am I happy with my purchase, absolutely. Would I buy one again. Yes.

R549:	I don't know why everyone is so enamored with this thing. I have had it over a year and I constantly have to baby sit it. It constantly gets stuck under chairs or shelving units, sometimes even corners. I find it sitting there beeping or dead if I leave it alone too long. I have to pick move throw rugs otherwise it will get stuck on them. The scheduled feature has never worked properly. Eufy says because my floors are too dark. Three apartments in a year, and didn't work properly on a single one of them. Even tried to program it on white counter tops and that didn't work. But seriously... who doesn't have dark colored floors? Not that I actually want it to work because I would come home to find it stuck somewhere anyway. I will give it credit for one thing. It's durable. As I'm cooking or at my standing desk and it's running over my toes repeatedly, I give it a good kick and it keeps on going... only to bang into some other piece of furniture the sensors didn't pick up. And it will pick up a good amount of stuff, but the brushes do tend to "bat" larger items. Oh, and be careful, it will go over stairs... got out onto the balcony once and I barely saved it from falling 14 stories below once. Explain that to the police department. As for eufy... I reached out to them about advanced trouble shooting regarding the scheduling, clearly stating the steps I already tried as suggested on the Amazon product page. The proceeded to tell me to try the same steps, but there's nothing they can go, it's out of warranty by about a month. Guess I should have been more worried about dealing with trivial things instead of dealing with hurricane aftermath and moving twice since. I debated how many stars to give... Two felt a little low cause it does ultimately do what it's supposed to and I don't have to do it myself... But the advertised features that don't quite live up and the fact I have to baby sit it and still need to spot clean after it runs makes three feel high. Ultimately, I guess I don't like it and wish I would have used the warranty and tried a different one.

R550:	This machine is quiet, gets up ALL of the animal hair and feathers (white cat, black dog, brown and white dog, and bird feathers - I've got it all!!), I'm learning where it gets stuck, so I block those areas. My Roombas had towers that prevented the machine from going under the stove, for instance, but they weren't all they were cracked up to be. The best thing about this is that it doesn't balk at doing small rugs here and there. My 800 series Roomba would get hung up trying to vacuum a rug under my coffee table, and it was not all that thick. This Eufy RoboVac accommodates the rug and gets it clean as a whistle. With the Roomba, I had to get out my regular vacuum cleaner just to get under the coffee table. Irritating!! So far, I'm in love with it. Saw some bad reviews about them quitting, so I did buy the service plan. But for what I paid for one Roomba, I could buy THREE RoboVacs! Great value!! UPDATE: Just missed the return window. It runs for two minutes and I have to restart it. Fully charged, have cleaned it thoroughly, put in new filters. What's up? How do I get in touch with the manufacturer to get this resolved?

R551:	Let me start with this: I really wanted to like this vacuum, and for some people it may be perfectly fine, but unfortunately, I am not one of them. Tried it out for a day and didn't like it the first day, but figured 'hey, let's give it more time' (largely at my wife's insistence)....so we tried it for almost a week. Over this week, the vacuum got stuck on a bathroom rug, banged into every wall/couch/table/chair/counter/you name it in the house, did a good job picking up dirt but a terrible job picking up pet hair (which was the whole reason we looked at this), died repeatedly in random locations throughout our relatively small (read: less than 1k sqft) house, and made it back to the charging station on it's own exactly one time (out of 10 attempts that we ran it). Pros: - It picks up dirt. If you don't have pets and none of the cons matter for you, this might be okay for you. - Freaks pets out. (I find this hilarious.) Cons: - Does not pick up pet hair - Gets stuck on simple bathroom rugs - Get lost throughout your house - Bumps into everything - Does not return to home base - Poor battery life - Does not work with Alexa (it has a remote, though)

R552:	Pros: Super handy. Don’t know how I lived for so long without one of these. I vacuum more frequently now since it doesn’t take any time off my day and I don’t have to go through the trouble of digging for the full sized vacuum in the closet. I just keep this one out, discreetly under a side table and turn it on with the remote whenever I want. I love that it has a remote and it's pretty simple to operate, as I'm not into connecting gadgets to my phone. Super practical and despite its small sized dust reservoir, it does a good job in keeping my hardwood floor clean and it also does corners pretty well with the little brush arms, which is great. It has two filters and the plastic one is easily removable and washable, as is the dust box compartment. Super practical. Cons: It doesn’t vacuum near its base, which is kind of annoying. It always keeps a distance from it, even if you try to send it there with the remote, it keeps turning around and going the other way. You either have to unplug the base and then send eufy there with the remote, which is kind of a pain, make peace with having that area more dusty than the rest of the house, or use a full sized regular vacuum in that area. Also, it doesn't seem to hold a charge as well as when I first got it. The sensors sometimes work great in keeping eufy from bumping into furniture, but for some reason, at other times, don’t seem to work at all, in that the eufy will go straight into a collision course with an object or piece or furniture, and bangs right into it, head on. All said, I’m happy with it overall. It’s practical and keeps the floor clean. However, the most annoying thing about eufy, besides not vacuuming near its base, is that it sometimes refuses to go under certain pieces of furniture where there’s definitely room for it to go under. Both my coffee table and my tv stand have about an inch of room above eufy, but it often refuses to go under them, even though there’s no obstruction on the floor. And what’s funny is that at other times it does goes under those pieces with no problem and takes its time there. So I don’t get it. On the days when eufy isn’t feeling like going under the furniture, I try to send it there with the remote, but it still refuses. It keeps turning the other way when it gets too close to the coffee table or tv stand. That’s the major annoyance. Aside from that, I’m loving not having to vacuum anymore.

They did offer one free side brush, but that was the one thing I didn't need replaced.

R554:	Is 3 years long enough? Worked fine for 3 years and now it just starts up and the light goes red and it stops and beeps for 30 seconds and turns off. Yes, it's been charged. Battery died? Something. I don't know why I waited so long to buy one of these things. I was a little leery of the unknown name brand but once the product came, I was impressed with the quality. I'm doubly impressed with how well it works. I did not expect it to pick up as much as it did the first time I used it. Frankly, I was kind of shocked at how much I was (obviously) missing by using a regular upright. Plus, this thing is just fun. It's like having a tiny semi-dumb robot wandering around your house that happens to be doing an excellent job of picking up the dirt you usually miss and often don't even see. It's not going to pick up paper or big things (come on.. you're not that much of a slob are you?), but for what it was designed for? Great product, well priced, high quality and downright fun to have around. It will get hung up from time to time. If you leave out a particularly thick rug or have a lot of wires on the floor that isn't tucked away, it can get stuck. It also tries to climb things (like my bathroom scale) from time to time, vs. navigating around it, and get's stuck, but rarely. When it does, it kinda cry's by beeping for a few minutes. Then it shuts down and waits for you to find it. All you have to do is hit the button on top and it starts right up again. Mine runs for almost 2 hours before the battery runs down and it, every so slowly, wanders back to its charging station, positions itself to recharge, and shuts off. I'm still amazed every time I start it up before leaving and coming home later in the day with a house that's been vacuumed and a little robot safely back in it's charger. It's kinda magical in a way. Kinda.

R555:	The eufy did a great job cleaning up most of the debris in my kitchen and mudroom areas, both of which are tiled. It seemed overly invested in cleaning the cat tree in said area, but I digress (it took the finish off the edges, because it would spend about 30 minutes of battery life going around in a 6 square inch square). It functioned well, and when I would rinse off the brushes, from time to time, the plastic fibers would "remember" their shape. I had to clean out bits of fur (pets) and my hair from the wheels and brushes, but that just proved it was sucking up trash. With no notice, it completely died about 3 days after the one year warranty lapsed. Those engineers who design these things to fail are clearly doing a great job. Unfortunately for me, the battery seems totally dead: it won't keep a charge. So, buy this and know that you run the risk of repeating what happened to me, and that's a dead battery/device.

R556:	Listen, I was probably like you. You probably heard your relatives or friends telling you "it's rubbish, don't buy it. It'll get stuck everywhere." Then you see the massive amount of reviews on Amazon and think "it'll probably be fine, they're just exaggerating." They weren't. This robot, while quiet, effective at picking up even the finest sand (PLAY sand, even!), and attractive, simply got stuck more often than not, and spent a lot of time recleaning areas it had already went over. Essentially, no matter how well it cleans, it's useless if it bumps around in the same area until the battery dies. I strongly recommend to the manufacturer that they look into intelligent pathing, and that you, the consumer, either wait for them to do so, or buy a unit that has intelligent pathing. Additionally, the robot doesn't always self return, and has died right in front of the charging station. $220 is too much to ask for such ineffective pathing.

R557:	I loved this when I got it. About 8 months in, the roller stopped and they replaced it with a new unit. Told me the new unit would have the same 1 year warranty. Received that and i was pleased again. Then, 8 months into that the battery is always dead. Now Eufy says they only warrant their replacement (brand new unit btw) for only 3 months. So for $250 I got 16 months of vacuuming. Also, this is great on rugs, fits under furniture well, but is not good on hardwood floors with the pet hair. Dust yes, hair no. If you get this, purchase extended warranty because you will need it. Very disappointed in the service. If you have a new product, it should have the 1 year warranty ESPECIALLY if it is replacing a new unit that crapped out after 8 months. In essence, I only got 11 months of warranty. Shame on your service. It is very telling when they only warrant a NEW replacement for 3 months. Bad Eufy!

R558:	We've had this little fella in our home for about 11 months now. My little dog barely notices any more. Great job with a mundane task. However... There are "intelligence" or programming issues with this machine. Firstly, if it ever gets hung up somewhere, i.e. on a thick rug, under a cabinet, under the kitchen table, under a bed/couch/chair, it will always get hung up in the same spots. You have to make a change to prevent it from going to those places. OK, I can do that. But now, nearly a year later, one of the drive wheels is failing. He won't go in a straight line any more. You can hear clicks like plastic gears are stripping. Not good. Our little vac really did a great job, but longevity needs improved. 200-300 per year for a vacuum is a bit too much too swallow. Intelligence also needs improved. Their needs to be several, pre-programmed avoidance or evasion plans built into the system. Because the one, which is pretty good, does not work all of the time. In fact it fails all of the time in the same exact places. Now, it will not work at all because it will not move correctly. Smart money may want to look at other offerings. Update: 8-23-18 Tried again to call customer service. They didn't open until 9am PST. I'm in CST... so had to wait till after work. Called them @ 4:35 CST got a recording that all customer service personnel were in a meeting to learn how to better serve their customers! For starters, leave personnel in place to answer customer calls... WOW! Still trying to get warranty repair before it expires. UPDATE: I got an email from customer support following this review. They have sent me a replacement RoboVac. We'll see if this one holds up better. Fingers crossed!

R559:	Purchased this vacuum in June 2017 based on numerous positive reviews and "best of" articles. It operated great for the first three months. It was cleaning a small area which included my kitchen, dining area, and living room. After about 3 months it started randomly shutting off during it's cleaning cycle. As time went on this got worse to the point where the vacuum would turn off every minute or two. I followed some online help and customer service suggestions to fix the issues; however nothing would help. I received a replacement around October 2017. Unfortunately the replacement had the same issues. Based on the numerous positive reviews, my situation could be a fluke. However, I requested a full refund, which Eufy provided. Eufy customer service was top notch and I give them a 5/5. Unfortunately I can't say the same for this vacuum.

R560:	I love this vacuum in theory. When it is working properly I love it in reality. But I have not had one that has lasted over three months yet. Thankfully there is an 18-month warranty and the company has continually replaced these. They are very fast and pretty much just take your word for it. I have even offered to return them and they have declined. Both of my eufys have just quit working. They spin in circles until they begin beeping to let you know. According to the company it seems to be some sort of sensor chip malfunction. Would not buy one of these again but if they ever improve their design I might be open to it because when they are operating properly they are fantastic. I have three dogs and a cat that lives inside as well as a 4-year old child . Aside from the malfunction they're excellent to pick up pet hair dander and even larger items. They are quite simple to maintain and take apart to clean. I think this company is on to something but they have some improving to do. I have been running my eufy since September of 2017 and am on my third eufy.

R561:	I've had this vac for almost and while for the first few months it worked great, it is now a nuisance and we no longer use it. It began stopping after about 15 minutes with a "dirty sensor" error so I would clean the sensors and start it again. Sometimes it would continue as usual sometimes it would only go for another 15 minutes before the same error. I thought maybe I wasn't sufficiently cleaning the sensors so I cleaned them even better with the same results. Now sometimes when we come home it's just sitting in the middle of the floor no beeps, no errors just sitting there with a full battery. So needless to say I would NOT recommend this robo vac.

R562:	The good: It vacuums way better than my Roomba ever did - I cannot stress that enough. It was almost embarrassing how much dirt this little thing found on what were freshly cleaned floors. It was so good at its job that we had no choice but to replace the maid since she clearly wasn't doing her best. Run time is great - about an hour and a half on a full charge - just park the thing overnight and you're good to go in the morning. We loved it for all of five days. The bad: It lasted five days. We found it doing jerky back and forth, side to side movements while mournfully beeping that its front bumper was stuck. After removing the bumper - no big deal, just a few tiny screws - no obstruction was found. A call to customer service confirmed a bad sensor. An RMA was issued and replacement was promised but has not been seen in over a week; no replacement shipment notification either. Based upon reps tone and other reviews, bad sensors seems to be the "thing" with this unit. So, we really did want to love this thing but it is going back while Amazon is still willing to take it back - waiting over a week for a replacement unit shipment notification is just too long. Too bad...

R563:	Price is good. Cleans well enough. Dumber than a box of rocks. The biggest offender is the dropoff sensor. I have a single story home so I wish I could just turn off that sensor. It will see a line on a rug and stop, or it'll roll over the weatherstrip of the front door and have a panic attack. It'll climb onto furniture with low slung bases and then freakout when it can't come off it. It's set to vac when I'm at work but I always come home to find it has found something to get "stuck" on. Then when I resume it the battery doesn't last much longer because it's been off the charger all day. My nickname for it is dumbot.

R564:	I'd give it six stars if I could! I did a ton of research trying to find a robot that would pick up pet hair, lots of it. We have 4 dogs, all indoor and it's like a hair farm around here. I would highly recommend to anyone with tile floors and lots of dust and dander on a daily basis. This little guy spends about 1-1 1/2 hours combing the floor, under tables, around table and chair legs, hallways, bathroom etc just quietly gathering the bits and pieces of "stuff". (Note: pick up dog toys, cords, anything it could get caught up on before you launch it). This is my new favorite cleaning device (I don't have many but I only buy what is proven to work). Eufy RoboVac exceeded my expectations and the price point is perfect. I am hoping the company comes out with a battery that I can buy when this one runs down. Other reviews have noted that it is in the works. Hoping they deliver, otherwise, that could be a deal breaker. But I remain hopeful and terribly happy with this workhorse. UPDATE May 2019: Robot quit working and started a series of 4 beeps. Cleaned it thoroughly as well as charger, tried to charge it directly, tried to find a way to reset it. Nada. Called customer service and yes, the one year warranty was up. They said "well, you can order a replacement battery off of Amazon and see if that solves the problem, if it doesnʻt you can return the battery". If you look at battery replacements on Amazon, the one for this robot does not work. AND, they donʻt accept battery returns. She then offered me a deal on buying a new one. MMMM...sorry. Iʻm done with you Eufy, weʻre breaking up for good. You have a great product...until it stops working. Planned obsolescence.

R565:	This thing is quite literally retarded. It has no smarts whatsoever to tell it to not coean the same places over and over, has no concept of how to not get stuck in common areas like under tables, and is constantly getting stuck on every little item in the house. Additionally it seems to need filters every 30 to 45 days which gets extremely expensive, and the scheduling options are nearly useless (ie I can set it to run at a time for every single day. No way to tell it to not run on weekends) additionally heaven forbid it gets turned off ever, your schedule is then gone with no indication until it does not run. I will gladly pay more for a name brand unit that actually works well rather than wandering around like a drunk thrown from the bar. I guess the good news is it can survive being thrown and kicked whenever it decides that my feet are what it wants to coean no matter how far away from me I place it (it will turn and then beeline right back to me, miraculously navigateing multiple doors and hallways to do so).

R567:	I don’t which is better- the customer service or the product itself. This is the best robot I’ve ever owned. I had some issues with my first purchase, but the Eufy team quickly responded and made things right. I would highly recommend giving your money to this company; they’re great. The robot itself is quiet compared to “higher end” models of rumba. I have two labs and the robot effectively cleans my floors of dirt and hair as well as my rugs and underneath furniture. It’s features are a huge plus, too! I cannot tell you how much time this little guy saves me by doing half my chores for me. I’m sooo pleased! Update: I am constantly having issues with my robot which sucks because they don’t seem to have set ways to trouble shoot problems at home. I’ve been back and forth with a representative, but the person is not consistent; I’ve been out a vac for a few weeks now. This is driving me crazy. My overall experience with this vac is that it’s great when it’s good, when there’s an issue- good luck. I’ve spent countless hours trying to fix my rumba, googling videos and reading forums. Seems like you should be able to fix the indicating problem without the assistance of a team member or without being sent an entirely new robot; that’s not what I’m looking for. If you need something reliable, hit up costco.

R568:	Two eufy Robovac 11 units with the same failure - red lights + 4 beeps after 12-18 months. I bought a eufy Robovac 11 on Prime Day 2017. Early 2018 it started making awful noises with the brush roller that cleaning and WD40-ing wouldn't fix. eufy sent me a replacement. After a few months, the original model started working again, so we used both. But starting in late July 2019, a few weeks apart from each other, they both started with the red light + 4 beeps error. We disassembled and cleaned both, followed YouTube tutorials and everything, but both fail within a minute of running. Best we can tell, pet hair and dirt gets into the brush motor and jams it. Not able to be cleaned or repaired. It's a shame, because these were excellent vacuums - super quiet, crazy long battery life, low profile to go under chairs and couches. When they work, they work well. But if they're all going to die after 12-18 months, I'll look elsewhere.

R569:	Here is some context so you know how I used the Eufy. I have ALL hard floor surfaces....approximately 1000 sq. ft. When I would run the Eufy, I would take up all my rugs, so the Eufy only went on hard surfaces in my home. I would run it once a week, but sometimes once every 10-14 days. Never more often than that. I have 2 short-haired dogs that shed very little. Each time I'd run Eufy, I'd have to empty it. It worked REALLY great....until it didn't. I kept the brushes clean and maintained the Eufy per the instructions, which was really simple and not time consuming. Point is, I took really good care of it and didn't run the thing every single day. I was so excited about this product when I found it! It worked perfect for approximately 9 months. There is a warranty of 1 year. After about 6 months, the robotics stopped working. When I would start it, it would undock and act as if it were going to clean. But, it would just spin in circles and then stop with an error (red blinking light). I contacted the manufacturer. They were really easy to work with. We troubleshot the problem for about 20 minutes and it didn't resolve the problem. She concluded that she needed to process a warranty exchange and sent me a new Eufy. I was pleased. I figured I just got a lemon. The new unit worked great for about 11 months. Then, the same thing happened. Now it's out of warranty and my only option is to buy another unit. For a couple hundred bucks, I expect the unit to last more than 6 months. I'm disappointed because I thought I found a great product that compared to the "big name" and more expensive robot vacuums. So, the moral of the story. I guess you get what you pay for?? I was told by Eufy that they have improved the robotics, which I don't doubt. But, I still don't want to spend another $250+ for something that won't last more than 6-9 months.

R570:	Pros: Inexpensive, good suction, gets under couches, excellent customer service Cons: Object Avoidance Mode stops functioning, black rugs can be problematic UPDATED 7/16/2017: Eufy sent me another unit to try out before sending back the first two. This one was used (there was still dirt in the tray), but it worked great—for about two days. Then its Object Avoidance failed just like the first two. There is either something systemically wrong with the chipset on the RoboVac 11 models or I have an unusual amount of bad luck. Eufy's email customer service was very prompt and courteous and allowed me to ship back all three units with no charge for shipping. And along with the full refund, they sent me a free Anker product for my trouble (I chose a portable charger). I'm hoping the next model RoboVac will have this problem fixed. If nothing else, this experience has convinced me to get another robot vacuum cleaner; my floors have never been cleaner. I just won't be getting another RoboVac 11. I'm keeping the rating at 3 stars mostly for the great customer service. But keep an eye on your RoboVac and watch out for the bumping-into-objects problem, especially if it's still under warranty. UPDATED 6/25/2017: Now Robbie's Object Avoidance stops working in about 14 seconds. Whatever is going on with these 2 units, it gets worse over time. I'm corresponding with Eufy and may just get a refund. These were on sale, so I bought two of them. (My home has two levels.) I have owned these units for about a month now. I named one “Rosie,” and the other one “Robbie,” for obvious sci-fi reasons. (These are house-cleaning robots, after all!) And it's obvious I'm also not the first to do this. I was initially very impressed with these vacuums. I had expected a glorified rug sweeper but they actually have some decent suction. While following along behind them, I can actually feel a decent amount of air blowing out from behind them. I ran both for the first time without vacuuming the house myself, and both ran until the battery ran low. Trays on both were VERY full. Run time is about 2 hours for each of them, slightly better than the 1.5 hours they promise. And they were very quiet, but now they bump into things which can get loud. Object Avoidance Mode (OAM) has stopped working correctly. OAM works at first, but within a few seconds on Rosie, and within a few minutes on Robbie, cleaning becomes a series of seemingly random collisions, sometimes hard, with walls and furniture. At first, I thought this was a sensor issue but now I think it’s a software issue. They both find their charging bases just fine. I have cleaned the front on both units where the sensors are located but the problem persists. I was going to send Rosie back, but Robbie has started having the same issue; it just takes him longer to start acting up. I first noticed this today. They both still manage to get the floors clean in my 1,800 sq.ft. house. I think I’ll go ahead and keep both of them, and hope that the 1-year warranty will be honored if they get worse. Considering that I bought both of these on sale for less than the cost of a single low-end Roomba and that they can get under my couches and chairs where the Roomba can’t, I’ll consider these worth keeping. You will need to robot-proof your house. Gather up all of your electrical cords. If you have black rugs, this vacuum may or may not have an issue with it. I think it depends on the material the rug is made of. Both of my units have no problem with my black bathroom rugs, but will consistently “get stuck” on the black areas of my multi-colored floor rugs in my living room and den. I had to get creative in keeping them out of those areas. On your small light-weight rugs, you may need to get some rug grippers or double-sided tape. They can suck up a rug corner and get stuck.

R571:	Stay away from this Vac!!!!!! Works great when it works. However, it shortly starts to beep and even after following all troubleshooting directions it doesn't correct the issue. I have done everything instructed to resolve supposed issues to no avail. Brushes cleaned, sensors, cleaned, wheels cleaned, etc This vacuum is spotless unlike my floors! After doing more internet research trying to see if I could find a way to resolve my issues I found that this was no unique to my vacuum and seems to be an issue with this Company/model. Learn from those who have gone before you and don't throw your money away on this. If I could give it 0 stars I would. I basically have a huge expensive hockey puck on my living room floor that serves no purpose. Update: I added a star to my review as Eufy customer service reached out to me after seeing my initial review. They offered and did send me a refurbished replacement for my non-working vac. At the time of this review the replacement is working and it is my hope that it continues to work. While I am skeptical of the vac I can say that Eufy's customer support is outstanding. My original vac was outside the warranty time period and technically they were under no obligation to do anything to correct my situation. The fact that they contacted me to try and make it right speaks volumes about this company. If I could give a rating separately for their service I would give them 5 stars for their customer service. I have not had the replacement vac long enough to change my initial opinion of it at this time.

R572:	The Eufy RoboVac 11 is a great little vacuum that does a great job for the price. The downside is as they always say "You get what you pay for". The vacuum lasts about 8-10 months and even with regular care and maintenance it will still go out on you. Luckily Eufy has a great warranty program but the downside is the warranty is not extended or renewed when it is replaced and your only option at that point is to buy a new one at full price. While I love the price of the Eufy I'll spend it else where to get a product that will last a bit long. Pros: Price Warranty Service - This is quick and only takes about 7-14 days to process you a replacement for the faulty unit. Quick free Amazon Shipping Cons: Battery Life - This thing starts to degrade quickly and it is not a user replaceable part. Cleaning Pattern - The vacuum will just wonder around aimlessly for 2 hours until the battery gets low. Then it wonders around looking for the dock. Longevity - I wouldn't expect this to last longer than the first year. Maintenance Cost - Getting official replacement parts is expensive and honestly isn't worth the hassle since it doesn't make a difference to change the spin brushes every 3 months, filter every 2, and beater bar every 6.

R573:	I have had 2 Roombas that have lasted awhile until one thing or another broke. This time I tried a different brand. It is very quiet and works great on hardwoods. My biggest concern is that it gets stuck frequently on my jute rug or a low threshold fireplace hearth. It will easily clear it to go on to the rug or threshold but then it gets stuck and can't go off. This never happened with my roomba. It seems to think the edge of the rug is a drop off and will just spin and spin stuck and not going off the rug. This is proving to be a big problem. As a result - I would not recommend if you have natural rugs on your hardwoods.

R574:	UPDATE: Eufy contacted me immediately after this review was posted and kept contacting me until I responded. They wanted to know specifics regarding where it was getting stuck (height of bookcase, length of carpet, etc). Once I provided that info they informed the vacuum was not specified for some of the heights and spaces the RoboVac need to get under and in between for my house. So be VERY careful about the specs and measure around your house. It got stuck constantly. On the carpet, under the bookcase, and so on. It also couldn't keep up with the hair (I have a corgi and cat). I really wanted to like it...

R575:	Our Eufy vacuum only worked for about a year. Now it beeps relentlessly as soon as you power it up - and it won't run. My husband tried to troubleshoot it (he had successfully done some troubleshooting previously), but this time to no avail. He also contacted the manufacturer - but they can't help either. Our vacuum is 17 months old, so it's no longer covered by warranty. Rubbish. And, as a side, the height of this thing is PERFECT for getting stuck 100 times a day under every set of cabinet doors in my house. I'd pass on this model and buy something better. Wish I had.

R576:	Works great as far as suction, but it's not a very smart vacuum. It goes around in no particular order bumping into things and usually misses big areas of the house before it runs out of battery. It does have a good battery life, so it can usually do a good job chalked up to perseverance. Because it doesn't have an intelligent way of navigating, it just goes forward until it bumps into something and then moves in a different direction. Sometimes this means that it just gets stuck in the same area of a room cleaning in a circle. It also almost never finds it's dock to re-charge when it's done (maybe 20% of the time?). I don't run it when I'm not home because it will usually get stuck on things and I have to go rescue it. I will say that it's a huge improvement on vacuuming or sweeping on my own, and I don't regret buying it- it's just that for the price I would think the technology would be much better.

R577:	My model 11 died at 13 months. If you look at your user manual and the one linked on the product page (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1WHHd-OAJS.pdf ), page 21, it clearly states that there is an 18 month warranty. So, when I tried to get my product serviced/replaced, I was told there was only 12 months. I tend to go by the printed information that comes with my device as the contract/gospel. So, I have a $220 robotic coaster that can deliver me drinks if I can work the remote expertly. I would stick with the more solid manufacturers in the space that stand behind their warrantees than eufy. That where I am off to next. By the way, reported this incident to the Amazon Investigations..so perhaps they will start supporting what they are selling.

R578:	We bought this vacuum about a year ago. It worked OK for the most part. Not good for deep cleaning, but it was good for in-between especially if you have a pet. Gradually the vacuum became more and more ineffective, getting stuck in corners or not picking up hair and dirt as it used to. The beeping and warning signs became more frequent until about a month after the warranty (one year) had expired, it stopped working all together. When I called their technical costumer service, they didn't offer to take a look at it or fix it. They simply said buy a new one with a offer to give me a refurbished version of the same vacuum. After spending $230+ dollars on this machine, spending additional dollars on a new vacuum is ludicrous.

R579:	if you're going to get one of these, then you need to robot-proof your home. that means no wires, no kitchen mats, no access to underneath the couch (because it'll never find it's way out. Still, it does pick up dust and debris. probably the most frustrating thing about it is that it can never return to its charger. It is supposed to do this on its own but instead i have to manually chase it down, turn it off and plug it in. Only worth it if you have very level floors with no carpet and no wires anywhere.

R580:	LOVED, Loved Eufy Robovac 11 until it suddenly took a dive down our stairs! Not even 2 and for most of a year, it was in storage while we moved and purchased a new home. Technically working for just over 6 months keeping our upstairs immaculate, it, for an unexplainable reason just went off the edge and down the staircase.. Now it beeps twice which indicates a side senor issue. Nothing rallies it. I called and emailed the company. No help! No repair dept. Once the unit is over a year old/ out of warranty, they don't care. They offered to help me choose a new one to purchase if I sent them a picture of our staircase and a measurement of the steps!!!! Really sad! I guess if you're ok with spending $200 every couple years, for a good vac then this one is ok. I'm just kinda feeling left high and dry!

R581:	I have had a roomba for several years. A friend has a eufy and I was amazed at how quiet it was so I bought one expecting to send it right back. I was shocked that it seemed to clean about the same but was so much quieter. I left both in the same room because I was still deciding which one would retire to the basement level. Fast forward a few months... The Eufy never comes on automatically. It just fails to follow a schedule. It gets lost/stuck every time it does clean and has to be manually returned to the charging base. 9 Times out of 10, when I press the “clean” button, it’s dead. I have to wiggle and jiggle it on its charging base to get it charging again. So while the roomba it 2x expensive and 10x louder, it works with little intervention.

R582:	I ordered this as a potential replacement to an aging Roomba 880. The device itself seems well designed and is not that much smaller than the 880 but is much less powerful. The "mouth" which gathers the dirt and dust is small (didn't measure it before I returned it but I would guess 5" wide) and the dirt container is about half the size of the Roomba. I can see this working for a relatively small 1 bedroom or a studio apartment without pets that shed very much. I only tried it once before it became clear that it would never work for me.

R583:	It does do a great job for the price. We run it every day. We have do have a dog and a cat, so it has saved me time. I don't have to vacuum everyday. This product was recommended to us and we figured at $200, this would be a great test run robot vacuum if we decide to upgrade it down the road. Now for the downside, it stops and an alarm goes off every 5-10 minutes. It goes over the air vent and thinks it is a set a stairs and stops. It gets stuck under furniture ALL THE TIME. I mean, you got your self under the couch, why can't you get out? Let a little kid putting his head through stair railings. Sometimes it just stops in the middle of the floor. One time we found it flipped upside down on one of the stairs, like a turtle. All in all, it does pick up a lot, but we will probably be upgrade it to something better down the road.

R584:	Sure, this little robot-vac was very inexpensive... and at first it did an amazing job. But once it dies, it dies. You can't buy replacement batteries for it. I have an iRobot vacuum, had it for seven years now, and it works great. Had to replace the battery once (and they sell it!). So if I took the cost of this vacuum and multiplied it by seven, it becomes far more expensive than the iRobot I have. I really wanted to like this, as I bought it for a small area on another story of the house. But I cannot recommend disposable electronics when there are versions out there that last longer for a lower cost (overall).

R586:	Pros: It picks up a LOT of stuff. Even after going over my house pretty thoroughly with a Dyson, the Eufy managed to mostly fill it's (decent sized) receptacle. No complaints at all with how well it vacuums. CONS: The terrain and obstacle avoidance SUCKS. You see that picture in Amazon's product images of the vac climbing over an area rug? It does not to this, at all. I have a low/no pile rug between two rooms and it gets hung up on it and stops almost every time. When it makes it even that far. Half the time it winds itself under my dining room table and can't get itself out through the chair legs. I've been running it almost daily for a few weeks, and it has not ONCE finished a cycle and returned to homebase. It has gotten stuck on something literally every single time I've run it. I used to have a Roomba and it never had this problem in the same environment.

R587:	I bought this after 2 months of research and I am so happy I went with this vs the roomba 690. I've only run it once and it cleaned my entire 700 sq ft apartment. It is so quiet you could def watch a movie or carry a conversation without straining. It's fast and it maneuvers so well. It went over my carpet and bump to the other room. It is beautiful and can fit under everything, including my low profile bed. I had swept yesterday so was amazed at how much it picked up! I highly recommend this, and hope it keeps working well! UPDATE: the sensors on my euffy seem to have broken and now it is basically a bumper car. It is also louder now and is ruining my furniture by bumping into EVERYTHING it also ran my little dogs foot over and hurt it! Maybe it was only good for a month?

R588:	I bought this back in 2017 and I left an early, semi neutral review. Well I'm back in 2019 to say dont buy this or any Eufy vacuum. The 11 has to be the dumbest piece of electronics I've ever bought in my life, and I buy a lot of electronics. Where do I start....can barely navigate dark carpet. Cant manage itself over floor vents. It FORCES itself to get wedged into anything possible....between couches, under a chair that it should know to bounce off of but instead keeps ramming itself into...it gets stuck on the edge of stairs. It will randomly start driving in a circle then throw an error. It will throw an error just cleaning. The rubber on one of the wheels not randomly comes off. I can go on and on about how dumb this thing is. I recently bought a Deebot which I returned 2 hours later because it too was dumber than a box of rocks (it would constantly just plow into its dock when trying to return and it also experiences similar errors). I will never buy a Eufy product again. Maybe I'm just the unluckiest guy when it comes to vacuums.

R589:	I really like this robot vacuum....when it works. We ordered one on Sept 4th, 2017. We have vinyl floors or ceramic through out the house. So no carpet. It did a wonderful job of keeping the floors tidy and picking up the pet hair. We have no small children in the house, we are empty nesters. After a month of scheduled daily operation, it quit working. It just one day stopped and would only spin in a circle. Being a IT guy, I tried rebooting it...no change. Removed the battery, waited several minutes with the power switch on, then replaced the battery. No change. I frankly forgot about it sitting in its dock for a month before I contacted Eufy Support via email (support@eufylife.com). This experience was not as bad as I was expecting. The asked me to charge it directly with the power supply, clean the contacts and senor array with a clean cloth. When that did not work, they asked me to send them video of the issue. Responses were prompt and their troubleshooting steps were complete. After the video they sent me another unit. My wife was very happy. Happy wife, Happy life! 2 weeks of again normal scheduled operation, this unit starts doing the exact same thing. This time it appears it has lost forward drive as I have been unable to get it to move forward, even manually controlling it with the remote. I have contacted Eufy Support again by reopening the same ticket. We will see what results this produces. Like I said, I enjoy Eufy when it works. I am willing to give them the chance to fix this before I ask for a refund.

R590:	I want to love this product. When it works, it’s great. We bought ours in May 2017 and it was great for the first 6 months. It started getting errors and I was able to get it going again for awhile. We changed filters and brushes fairly regularly. It would work for awhile and then give false errors. I would switch it on and off and it would start up again. Finally, it’s just stopped working with a side brush stuck error. We’ve replaced brushes again, it no luck this time. I realize that it’s out of warranty, but just beware that it didn’t make it 2 years. We have other Eufy products that we love (bulbs, portable vacuums) but this one just didn’t last.

R591:	A must have if you have pets. You will be shocked how much hair/dust it picks up every single day. Cannot testify how good it is on carpet... I have only used it once in a carpeted area, and it seemed to do an OK job. Definitely good enough for daily use then deep clean with a more powerful vacuum biweekly. UPDATE 1/2/2020 Changed from 5 starts to 2. The first one crapped out within 2 months, Eufy was quick to send me a new one. That one lasted for a year with some weird bugs (sometimes would just stop and flash red) ... after a year (past the warranty) it started to not be functional. It just beeps constantly - I have looked up troubleshooting tips and nothing seems to work. I even replaced the brush roll. Im giving a 2 star instead of 1 because at least euphy has been responsive in trying to help. But I really am of the mindset that a purchase like this should last at least 4 years. And it barely lasted 1 year (with the first one lasting 2 months). Quality is a big deal to me as I strive to reduce waste.

R592:	Bought this from Amazon warehouse as a damaged packaging deal. Thing didn't last 3 months before one of the turning brushes died. Worst thing is, even though it's supposed to have a 1 year warranty, which it obviously needed, nobody would honor it. Eufy says they won't because Amazon sold it and Amazon won't because they said it's after 30 days. Unreal. So I got a defective item, and had a 1 year warranty turn into 30 days. Very disappointed in Amazon as well as Eufy.

R593:	I bought this item for my second home and it worked ok - it picked up some dirt, but also left a lot behind. The unit is not very smart though: it's algorithm causes it to gravitate towards the same exact places in the room, but NEVER corners and seldomly outside of the path it takes 95% of the time. I wasn't amazed by its performance by any means, so I didn't use it much. A couple of months ago, it woke me up in the middle of the night beeping over and over and wouldn't stop. I contacted support and even though it got used MAYBE a couple of times per week, every other week... it was purchased > 1yr ago, so no support. The unit functions just fine, but when it returns to the charger... HOURS LATER it starts beeping and won't stop!! Now I'm stuck with an obviously defective unit that keeps me up at night, so I'm going to have to replace an otherwise functioning vacuum.

R594:	I really liked this at first. I used this on our hardwood floors. It is quiet, well-built, low-profile, and nice to not clean up daily from kids constantly dropping food from the table. My review would have ended there until I started to find piles of crumbs pushed into edges and corners of the room as well as under the refrigerator. I started watching it closely and realized it picks up much less than I first thought. While the floor starts to appear to look clean, I saw that the vacuum would go over crumbs and maybe pick up half of them. The other half were just swept around the floor until they were eventually out of the middle of the floor and into the nooks and crannies of the room. It is really frustrating and disappointing to see it only spread a mess. I haven't tried other robotic vacuums so maybe my expectations are off but I know it is not an issue with a regular vacuum. I really want to like it but it probably needs more suction power and/or more effective brushes.

R595:	I loved the vac and did regular recommended maintenance. After about 17 months or so it started spinning in circles and would not move. I checked all parts for hair, string, etc. Finally called Eufy. Was told that it had probably reached the end of its usable life. I was dismayed at the short term of its usable life since I've had Neato Vacs for 5 or more years. Bought another Eufy because of the price, but be aware that it is not a long term investment.

R596:	First of all I would say it cleans well. But, it cleans well when it can reach the spot. In a few "test" runs, while we were watching it cleaning, it surely misses a few spots and left them uncleaned. It's like hit or miss. If it hits, it cleans but if it misses some area, it does not come back. We tried both auto and room modes, but it did not work. Returning it. I think the algorithm for routing in a room needs some work, will try roomba.

R597:	So I didn't want to review until I had it for a while and would say that I do love it but it has some flaws. I bought this because I have a German Shepherd and this is supposed to be good for cleaning pet hair and it is. First week it picked up a ton of dog hair without any issues but a month in it started leaving a pile of hair randomly. It is worse to see a pile of dog hair than it is have them all over because you don't really them otherwise unless you really look. It does this every single time now. Also, it has to go some spots multiple times before it actually pick anything.

R598:	I’ve had my Eufy Robovac for about 3 months now, and at first it worked great. However, the last 2 times I tried to use it, it wouldn't even get started, and it’s been sitting on the charger with the light indicating it is charged. I use it in a small apartment and it does not get abused. It's used in 3 rooms once every other week when I'm too lazy to clean with my big vacuum. It worked nicely and picked up a lot of dirt. But suddenly it just doesn't want to leave the home base anymore.

R599:	We had the eufy for 2 years and loved it! It worked very well in between deep cleanings. We were not able to set the schedule for it to clean while we were away, but that was okay. It also found it difficult to retur to its base. We found the most efficient way to clean was to trap it in one room at a time. We would have given this product 4 stars. However, after 2 years of (not excessive) use, it is no longer working. It starts, then stops & beeps four times. We contacted customer care and was told the brush motor was not working and that it is useless at this point. This is not acceptable and we will not purchase another eufy as we replace the item. Beware that it has a limited lifetime and then you will be on the lookout for a new one!

R600:	Customer service was great but I’ve had two of these now over less than a year and while it does clean fairly well (corners and edges leave something to be desired) the real problem is the degrading performance. If I can get one or two weeks of full runs in before the vacuum starts to stop every few feet and beeps incessantly, I’m lucky. We are always trying to find where she stopped and it’s never the same place. It’s not much of a help when you have to keep walking around and press the button:/

R601:	OK, THIS will be the final edit. I've given up on it. Back to 2 stars. There is some flaw in the infra-red sensor(s) whereby they fail after a few days use so the vacuum bangs into things. This will and has scarred up walls, furniture, etc... The wipe off the front trick worked for awhile but is now of no effect. It's too bad, I wanted to like this and very much did when it worked properly. Customer service sent a free one to replace the first defective one so they did their best. Final edit and a USAGE TIP - Once again, customer service is not great from a process standpoint but they have actually solved the problem in an expeditious and generous way. TIP - If the vacuum loses it's avoidance ability and starts running into things, wipe off the front of the curved bumper with a cloth. I know it looks clean. I know it will look approximately the same after you wipe it. I know this sounds dumb. But try it. This restores the avoidance behavior on mine. Maybe it's magic; like a lamp. Edited AGAIN - I was too harsh on customer service. After I returned the vac to Amazon I was contacted again and Eufy has bent over backward to make things right. We'll see how the vacuum works out but the customer service has gone above and beyond. (Yes, if I could think of another cliche I'd probably use it, too.) Edited - from 5 stars to 2 Since the original review, this has become a disappointment. I can forgive the occasional missed run-time and it getting stuck under things but its ability to avoid objects in front of it has gone away so it bangs into furniture, walls, etc.... Eventually everything will be scarred up so it's going back. Customer service is not problem solving oriented, sending form responses suggesting cleaning the bumpers (duh, it runs into things so the bumpers work, the problem is in the infrared sensors) and asking for videos in response to an inquiry that complains that it runs into things. If you look at the manufacturer's comments to poor reviews, you'll see the form of response you'll get. A waste of time. Original- I've had previous generation Roombas and Neatos. This is better - and cheaper. It is well thought out and its inputs are simple and logical. It runs a long time on one charge, more than an hour and a half, and as long as it's not in a separate room returns to its charging station when finished. It can be programmed (easily) to start automatically at the same time each day. The vac does not run into large items (walls, sofas, corners, etc) but it will impact smaller obstructions such as chair legs, shoes and similar. It doesn't travel at a high rate of speed so even those are fairly gentle impacts. Suction is fine, leading to dumping the bin about every cycle. Cleaning the dust bin is easy and not messy. I thought having a remote was just a gimmick but it, too, is well designed and convenient to use. All and all, I am pleasantly surprised at its excellent engineering and performance. Considering the price of the more well known competitors, it's a bargain.

The unit was donw for some time when we sorted it out. It promptly stopped realistically functioning again and it now just collects dust. We may have had 6 months of use in this device and was a huge waste. It gets suck everywhere and requires constant monitoring and continues to die in the middle of the floor for no reason. I can’t recommend this unit or brand regardless of model.

R604:	Edit(11/13/18): I’m afraid I’ve come to the end of road with Eufy. The machine worked fine, most of the time, but it just didn’t last. It doesn’t make sense to pay that much for something that will last only 6 months. Since my original machine was out of warranty, they don’t care if the second one malfunctioned as well. I gave an additional star for customer service and honoring the first warranty, but I can’t buy it again and I recommend you don’t either. Edit (11/11/18): I’m unhappy again. In less than 6 months, BRAND NEW “upgraded” unit did the same thing! It alarms saying the brush is stuck. There was nothing wrapped around the brush or any visible reason for it to be stuck. I even replaced the brush, but it still alarmed and does not work at this point. I’ll try customer service again. Edit (5/10/18): I’m happy again! Their upgraded replacement Eufy arrived in 2 days on a Sunday morning - super fast. This new unit has been cleaning very well. I had trouble getting the schedule to run properly, even after getting the appropriate beeps after programming, but it finally stuck. Customer service is definitely superb! I hope this one continues working as well as it is now. Edit (4/27/18): Since several other reviews mentioned customer service, I contacted them after the last review. After a few exchanges of videos and troubleshooting attempts, they concluded it was a faulty unit and are shipping another. I’ll update how that goes. Edit (4/17/18): Now 6 months in and the stars are falling Down from a 5 to 3 and possibly more. :(. Occasionally, Eufy would “forget” the schedule for no known reason. Even after explicitly setting it to the same thing, it woudn’t go. Eventually, it would catch and all would be well again. It’s been much worse in the last month. What makes it even worse - to the point I’m ready to ditch it - it that it won’t go for more than two minutes without alarming — for NO reason! It’s running over a perfectly smooth, clear, hardwood floor and just stops and alarms. SO disappointing! Oh, Eufy, I so want to like you again! It's still early (just 4 days in), but I love my Eufy so far! While not perfect, it gets up a significant amount of dust and dog hair from our hardwood floors every day. Every little bit helps! I'm still learning its idiosyncrasies.

R605:	My unit went wrong just out of warranty. I took it apart and found that despite being a vacuum cleaner, the main motor is not well sealed. It was jammed full of hair. I contacted Eufy for repair, but they don’t repair. I asked where I can buy a new motor, but they don’t sell parts either. They did offer me a discount on a new unit, which is better than nothing I suppose. If you’re comfortable spending over $200 on a year’s worth of robot vacuuming then fine, the unit works reasonably well. Otherwise buy a brand with better quality.

R606:	Gets worse over time. At first it was great and did amazing. After about a month it started getting a wild hair up it's butt and would take off full blast at the cabinets or fridge and get itself stuck. Moving it every once in a while was okay. After about 3 months you can't even walk out of the room without it starting to beep because it is stuck. We tried cleaning it thinking maybe the sensor was dirty but it's not even worth using anymore it's so annoying. I will put it across the house and it will go straight back to the kitchen and get stuck.

R607:	I had an iRobot that worked great until the battery died. I got this one based on great reviews and the relatively low cost compared to iRobot. This turned out not to be a smart purchase. Often, the robot will beep, asking to be rescued due to one reason or another. If you don't react fast enough, it turns into where is my robot hunting game. When it is not stuck somewhere, it will likely ran out of juice before it tried to return to the home base to charge. On a few occasions, the robot will get so very close to the home base, but will fail to dock itself correctly to start charging. I am guessing either there is a fundamental design flaw in power monitoring / management or I am unlucky to get a defective unit. Overall, the robot requires too much baby sitting, we simply don't use it anymore. Another white elephant in the house.

R608:	This robot was awesome for 5 months. It cut down drastically on the dust and pet hair. But alas it has died. It runs for a few minutes on the hardwoods but it doesn't suction anything and then it starts to beep 4 times and quits. According to the instructions it's the rolling brush that's malfunctioning but I've cleaned it and yet it still beeps. Though I got this for $215 I'd hope that it would last a few years, not a few months. Especially after my family has gotten so use to this guy we even named him... Romeo... Since he roams... RIP Romeo.

R610:	Straight off, I really liked the Eufy. It kept the floor tidy, and let us save the bigger vacuum for more thorough cleanings. It cleaned and made it back home successfully maybe 75% of the time. It got stuck in maybe three places consistently: one over dark floor vents, and a couple of places where it wedged itself under a cabinet. Then suddenly it stopped working. Beeping during charging. Contacted Eufy support. They said 15 months old, so no longer under warranty. Nothing they would do. From hints on the internet and personal experience, I suspect that either the battery no longer charges, or something in the charging mechanism itself is borked. You can replace rollers and such, but not the battery. For something I expected to work for several years, I'm pretty disappointed. That makes it a pricy, disposable toy. I'm considering a new vac, but certainly a different brand that I think will last longer.

R611:	When I first got my vacuum in May I was in love and I was planning on buying one for everyone in my family for Christmas!!! The suction was so good, it worked on tile and carpet. I set the timer and would empty it once a day and my floors were always SPOTLESS. Fast forward to October/November...it stopped working on the timer, there is hardly any suction. I have bought replacement parts and filters thinking it would help but no. Super disappointed! I ranted and raved to all my friends about this product and now I am hoping they dont buy one for themselves because it wont work after a few months!!! Calling customer service, I will update with how they handle the situation.

R612:	This isn't as great as I had hoped it would be. It does get the floor pretty clean, and I love the fact it can get under the coffee table and other furniture without me having to move it, but it keeps getting stuck (e.g., trying to get under the fridge, under the couch) and I have to rescue it. So, I can only run it when I can monitor it, which kind of defeats the purpose. I feel like there is also a fair amount of prep required before running it--moving shoes, the bar stools, electric cords.

R613:	Plugged this thing in and let it work(it was already charged) I love it. Not too noisy and does a good job. Amazing how much it picks up After trying to get a reply from the maker or the seller when the Vac quit working properly, I have been trying to get results from the extended warranty i bought but I feel like I am just getting the run-around and no results. They suggested something but that did not fix it. If I am going to be very upset if I can not my vac replaced.

R614:	Less than one year from our purchase, and we are already replacing for a second time. Customer service has been great, but I'm glad I purchased the optional extended (3-year) warranty. We'll see how useful that is when (not if, but inevitably when) we need it. Otherwise, we like the vacuum. It's significantly quieter than the Neato (which also had several failures). Gets stuck less often. Cleans just fine.

R615:	UPDATE! After receiving a replacement because the last one did even last past 6 months the new one dies. I dunno. At this point I think I’m gonna go with a dyson cordless vacuum now. These aren’t worth the money as they don’t last Love this vacuum! However recently it started to go in circles and then would just stop. I had it for maybe 4 months. I reported the issue and the company sent me a new one. The new one works awesome and I even see how much more “smarter” it is. This new one seems to be more aware of objects around it. Hopefully it won’t act up like the last one. Fingers crossed

R618:	Even better than expected! She cleans like a pro. Cleans along baseboards and under furniture. I would have a hard time going back to a regular vacuum if it breaks. Awesome Amazon deal of the day price at $150. 7-14-17 Update - Not awesome anymore sad to say. Today Eufy stopped working. The indicator light said the roller was stuck but it wasn't. I called the company and they were great. The customer support lady had me try a couple of things to fix it and then she decided to just send me a new one. She said to recycle the one I have and not to bother returning it. Hopefully the new one will work, because we loved this product when it worked. I'll update if it fails like the first one did.

R619:	Not a fan of this product at all. I live in a fairly large one bedroom apartment building. For whatever reason, this vacuum does not like my place. Everything starts off working perfectly, but now I have had 3 different units (my original purchase, a brand new replacement, and then a refurbished replacement) all have the sensor fail. For the first 2 months, the vacuum will sense that it's nearing a wall, and purposefully turn and go a different direction, but on all 3 units I have had, that sensor eventually fails and it will run full speed into walls, the oven, shoes, anything. It's a shame, because the product starts great, but in the end, it just seems destined to fail.

R620:	We have concluded since purchase in September, 2017 that the term EUFY RoboVAC 11 is a cryptic message, possibly in Klingon, for mechanized junk. The machine goes in circles. This started with less than ten hours of use. The instructions suggest that this is caused by stuck bumper switches and depressing a releasing the bumper is sure cure. Well at first it worked be it only a short term solution. Now it has reached a point were only the forced created by a trash compactor circleswould alleviate the pain suffered by the EUFY RoboVAC 11. 1-12-18. I am editing my original review because I have spoken with the company and had a very positive experience. They are replacing the defective robot, and advised that we keep the original one for spare psrts. The gentleman I spoke with was very personable and accommodating. He was working hard to make the experience more pleasant. I will give the robot another chance, and we'll see what happens. I actually enjoyed using it when it was working with no complaints.

R621:	This worked reasonably well until, 3 months after purchasing, it just completely stopped charging. I put it into the charging dock, and it indicates it's charging, but when removed and the "clean" button is pushed, it just goes dead. When it worked, it did a good job ridding our hardwood floors of dust-bunnies. The only frustration is that it tends to get jammed into the slight overhang of our lower kitchen cabinets, as well as the bottom part of the refrigerator.

Eufy support is great if it's under warranty, if not you are out of luck. The life of product to cost ratio is definitely not worth it.

R625:	I both love this little guy and find him extremely frustrating. I have hard floors and I like to walk around barefoot. And my allergies are becoming increasingly severe. So clean floors are a must for me. But I'm really lazy. I do a quick vacuum every day, but there's lots of places I can't or won't bother to go. Eufy can get to many of those places. He can even sometimes get out of those places. He does pick up a lot when he's there, too. I like that this vacuum can get under the treadmill and the reformer and the couch and the bed. I don't like that he's gotten stuck under the treadmill a couple of times. He also really hates scales. I mean, don't we all, but scales seem to be about the only things he'll aggressively push around. I do have a couple of small rugs in my bathroom. Sometimes, he humps up onto the rugs no problem and sometimes he gets stuck. So I decided to just keep him out of the bathroom. He also doesn't really pick up hair, of which I have a lot. They just get tangled around his various brushes. The two things I hate the most though: 1) He's fantastically inefficient. I can vacuum my entire 1200 sf house in about 10 minutes. He'll wander around for an hour and not get everywhere. 2) He doesn't obey when I tell him to go back to his dock. I'll push the home button on the remote and he'll sing at me to let me know he understood, then he'll go back to wandering around randomly. I push it a couple more times and the same thing happens. Eventually, I end up using the remote to guide him close, and then he figures it out.

After a couple months the bearings in the brush wear out and the eufy will not run with the worn out brush anymore. It goes a few feet and then beeps. This happened with the previous brush as well. But you can't find replacement brushes anymore so the eufy is useless.

At 13.5 months our unit started 8 beeps and solid red light tried trouble shooting steps suggested by support to no avail. Old review: Works great for the price. Got it because of the great reviews and the deal price. Really helps keep our floors clean. Be weary of leaving charging cables or laptop cables on the floor because he can get stuck and he does have an issue with going into our sun room with a 1/2 threshold bump. But I am still really happy with this purchase great bang for buck!

R629:	I bought this after reading numerous reviews on Amazon and other 3rd party sites as well and everyone gave it a solid grade. I'm going to give it 3/5 stars. Its best quality is the price point. It is a very good value and is a quality mid grade robo vacuum. However, mine broke and started going in circles after only using it 3 times. In addition, its a bit clumsy and can get stuck easily against some of the furniture. I'm sending mine back and will not buy another one unless the price comes down more or something better comes along.

R630:	Still can't get the scheduling to work. Works ok but is pretty dumb. Just runs into things. Battery is great. Does 2000 sq/ft and then dies. It doesn't always take itself home though. Sucktion is great. It picks up lots of dust and dog (Bernese mountain dog) hair. Overall I'm happy for the price but I think a more expensive bot wouldn't get stuck as much and the scheduling would work.

R631:	The product might work for someone else but its not for us. It kept getting stuck under couches and around tables. Must be a programming issue and them just shuts down. We have thin carpet all upstairs and its seems to struggle cleaning it. When its running the front of the vacuum is slightly lower than the back so it can go under an object but the back end of it gets stuck...maybe its due to the carpet however for a simple carpeted home this isn't the right product

R632:	I have now had my second vacuum break down since my original purchase in November 2017. The vacuum will last a little longer than 6 months before failure occurs. In both situations, the vacuum just stopped working and kept beeping with the red light flashing. I called the company for assistance and I was told that even I was on my second vacuum, I was beyond my original purchase date and nothing could be done. I was offered a 20% discount on a new purchase. Really? Like I want to spend another $200 on a product that will not last 6 months?? Save your money and your aggravation... this company doesn’t stand behind its products!

R633:	One month out of warranty and this thing is extremely loud. Can’t really be in the same room with it while it’s running any more. Disappointed, liked it for the first 12 months. Edit: Adding a star for good support. They offered a percentage off a new one (not a significant amount). When I declined, they then offered to send a refurbished unit as a replacement. Support is good, just not comfortable enough to trust the brand quite yet.

If this happens long enough and the battery dies, it will never recharge again. I replaced the battery once but this happened again and the batter will just not charge after its completely drained.

R635:	Loved it when it was new but after 4 replacements, I'm over it. Each model works great for about a month then it seems like the sensors burn out. Instead of avoiding objects, it rams right into them. To the point where it knocks things over. I tried cleaning the sensors and that didn't work. It also seems to get stuck multiple times in the same spot during a cleaning mission. Super annoying.

R636:	I bought two of these robovacs, one for each floor of my house. We have lightly colored hardwood floors. Worked great for just a little over a year (outside of the manufacturer warranty) both started having computer malfunction where they only go in a tight circle and then shut themselves off. The extended warranty company was totally unhelpful and not easy to work with. They returned my vacuums unfixed. These eufy robovacs are useless if they don't work and there is no mechanism to replace if they malfunction due to poor computing. I'd give it no stars if that were an option.

R642:	The robot does a good job of cleaning hardwood floors but is really pretty dumb. It gets stuck on cords and floor mats. My old roomba would not get stuck nearly as often. The remote is ok.

R643:	Eufy looks and feels like a solid machine, and I like his name. Unfortunately my first vacuum didn't work right out of the box. I charged it over night as instructed then when I hit start I got a disappointing error beep. I called support and they quickly shipped me a new one. The new one worked great it picked up a lot of dirt and did a great job, very comparable to my friend's Roomba. Two weeks later I got an error beep saying the brush was stuck. I called support, they told me it needed to be replaced. I asked a for a refund, two broken units in a month was enough for me! Their support was very easy to work with though.

It often gets stuck at the same place within the same cycle, and we have to "babysit" the robot and rescue it often from being stuck. It can be quite frustrating and inefficient.

When it stopped working (under warranty) I had to disassemble it to clean it, then send video PROOF that it didn’t work to the manufacturer. It took almost 3 weeks just to get a return label to send my faulty vacuum in. When they sent my “replacement” I opened the device to find that not only did they just send me back my ORIGINAL, FAULTY, vacuum...but they had removed the base charger! Now I’m stuck with a vacuum that doesn’t work, and can’t even be charged up to NOT vacumm my home. Ridiculous customer service.

R652:	His name is Hungry Boy and he's an idiot and I love him. I run this weekly to keep my 100% tile apartment floors from getting gross on my feet. He runs into black stuff and tries to vacuum over bars of my folding tables, god bless him. He got stuck on the anti-fatigue mat in the kitchen when he tries to dismount it at an angle, and it's not that steep. He literally can't find his dock if he's more than two feet from it. He largely just does the same area over and over again if you don't move him yourself if you're in a small apartment with a little hall like me. He will literally vacuum over my feet which TICKLES SO MUCH. But Eufy/Anker are very ON TOP OF IT and sent a kind e-mail with instructions to fix my schedule problem and some running tips. Most of these little issues don't mean much in the long run, unless you have really particular robo vacuum needs. You should maybe check out a higher price range or the newer IQ boost models. I still use him often and still adore him. And I can tell if I forgot to run him before, because the bulk of the tile is always noticeably smooth. But for the price range, he's a GREAT robot vacuum. Really good suction and perfect for tile floors. It takes a few passes on low pile carpets like small, thin rugs. But he does do that on his own. With the tile it's great. No more hair, no more kitty litter, no more dirt and dust, no more crumbs. Hungry boy has GOT THIS. He gets right up against the baseboards and underneath tables, desks, and shoe racks. His tank is big enough for two runs of my apartment. The filter works very well at cutting allergens. You can hear him running from another room, but he's not loud at all or even annoying. He's not a smart vacuum. He's got no apps and won't learn. He's just a dumb little hungry robot who will help you with your floors, so don't be expecting a thousand dollar from this little guy. But DO expect to make your life so much easier. With my disabilities, he is a lifesaver. I don't even own a broom anymore. My Husband likes to put him in manual mode and clean the floors FOR FUN!!!! HE DOES CHORES FOR FUN!!! He's a hit with guests. My cat isn't a big fan of him but Hungry boy can't see black things so that's Hungry boy's fault. I was hoping they'd team up and fight crime in my community. She smugly tolerates him from heights instead, like batman. The bottom line is that this little robo does a lot of the vacuuming for you as long as you clear all cables and cords (he has dragged my cat's fountain out of the wall) and thick rugs from his path. His suction is also pretty serious, he will suck the heck out of bathroom rugs that are thin enough to let him ride. There are suction marks and my rug is always dragged around the bathroom. ---- EDIT: 6/20/18 purchased 4/22/17 It's been a year and his battery doesn't seem to be as strong as it used to be. Instead of dying somewhere near the dock (or even making it back to the dock, he did do that maybe 3/5ths of the time) I usually find him tuckered out in the living room now. I was sort of anticipating a longer battery life from this company since that their parent company makes some fantastic rechargeable portable batteries. I ended up having to buy a broom. I hope there's a firmware upgrade or something to help optimize his runtime so I can get more out of the reduced battery life. At the rate it's degrading I'll probably need another hungry boy within 2 years so I hope the battery life stops fading. tl;dr: Pros: great for tile, massive effort saver, runs pretty quiet. Cons: you need to babysit him or do some serious floor prep to keep him away from danger or getting stuck

R654:	I purchased this vac based on the reviews after returning the IRobot 850 from Costco. This unit is fine for the price and better than nothing. It does a decent job of cleaning, but even with the 2 brushes I have watched it roll over a piece of dirt it and miss it. It gets stuck on low pile rugs more than I think it should. The IRobot rarely got stuck. It is much quieter than the IRobot which is a plus. The IRobot rarely made it back to it's base, where as this makes it back more often than not. So, for $200 it's ok, I suppose.

R658:	Worked great when we first got it. About a month and a half in it just stopped working well. Missing a lot of stuff on the floor. I got this because I have a dog and wanted to make life easier with vacuuming, but trying to constantly fix issues or play around with it to see why it's not working is very disappointing and takes more time than regular vacuuming. I would really like to get my money back on this product, because it was an expensive tool that doesn't operate correctly...

R659:	I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have a dog. I do really like it, but it does not work well for dog hair. It pushes clumps of hair around and doesn't ingest them. Especially if it encounters a rug, then it leaves clumps of dog hair on it. Other than that, it's great, amazingly quiet and the low profile allows it to get under furniture my other robot vacuum could not.

R660:	I had to come back and update my review, because this vacuum didn’t even last me a year. Whenever I try to run it it just seems to get trapped in one room until I move it to another. It also randomly just decides to stop and starts beeping as if it’s stuck somewhere, often when it’s in the middle of the floor.

R669:	You start it in the docking station. You would think it would remember where that was and could easily navigate back to it. But no, its movements seem to be random, only changing direction when it runs into something. In the first 10 days the best time back to the dock was 12 minutes, worst time was never as It did not find the dock and the battery went dead. It went under a standard dining room chair and spent ten minutes bumping into the legs, basically going in a circle until I let it out by moving the chair. What I was expecting was a machine that would "size up" a room by following the perimeter then develop a logical pattern to clean the room. What I got was a dumb bot that just wanders around bumping into things and you hope it cleans everything. After two weeks it did not improve and we could actually see areas of dust that it missed day after day. We are sending it back.

R670:	The saga of our Vacuum "Brenda Bot" continues with a thud. We have cleaned the unit and tried to restart but she continues to run in to the walls blindly. It appears a sensor has gone bad. It is still able to clean just bounces from wall to wall at full speed. I reached out to customer service this morning and will wait to hear back. My original review is below and still works the same. I spoke with their customer service and they were determined to make it right. I still have a use for the unit although not the area I had planned. Again I think the product is good just not for every home. This is my first robo vacuum and was pretty excited to try it out. At first I wasn't disappointed. It has good suction, travels over all our floor mats without issue, and is very quiet. The main issue with this unit is that it gets stuck every time it cleans. I think the front bumper could be designed in such a way that doesn't allow it to wedge under things. It got stuck both under the fridge door and a decorative table. The only options to stop it from getting stuck is to block in to rooms it doesn't have issues or alter our house. Our floor plan is very open so there is not a practical way to box it in to a room. One feature that would fix this is virtual walls which this vacuum doesn't support. All of that said it is still a great product for the price if your expectations are realistic and your rooms don't have furniture the exact wedging height. As a bonus it keeps the kids entertained for an hour while they chase it around. It even survived my youngest trying to ride it. If you have young kids this will probably happen and they will also see how much it can "eat". Always check the dust bin when emptying for "keep" items.

R672:	I've been using this for about a week now. My 3-star rating is based solely on how it works for me. This is my first robotic vacuum, so bear in mind that I have nothing to compare it to other than my upright, a Eureka "Multicyclonic" (has a designation for "Pet"). We have two dogs and two cats. So, yeah. The Eureka does an amazing job with pet fur on every surface, high pile carpet, low pile carpet, tile, hardwood floors. There are two knocks on the Eureka: 1) Can't do stairs and, 2) can't get under the beds. The RoboVac can't do stairs either, but it can get under beds. With our zoo, we really should vacuum daily, or at least every other day. But we're busy folks, and the last thing we want to do when we get home is vacuum. Hence, the impetus to try the RoboVac. First negative was the instruction on the amount of space required for the charging base: Two meters straight out and one meter on both sides, where there is an outlet nearby. This is probably overkill. When I started the RoboVac, it pulled straight out, and when I sent it "home", it positioned itself about two meters directly in front, and then turned and went into slow crawl back to the base. If I were keeping this (more below), I'd experiment with the space requirements. BTW, several reviews have mentioned how quiet the RoboVac is, and I give it five stars on that. Before the first use, I gave our floors a thorough cleaning with the upright. The following day, I put the RoboVac through its paces. I did not pick up or move anything because I wanted to get a real world test of what it could do and how it would avoid obstacles. I was impressed with its ability to avoid rag towels that we use to wipe the dogs' feet when they come in from the outside during the wet, soggy season here in Michigan. Same with dog toys. It handled the transition from tile floor to a room rug with no problem. It really does appear to move in a very random pattern, and I'm pretty sure that it hopes to cover the entire surface in the time a full battery charge gives it. I did notice where it covered the same area several times before it finally "found" an area it hadn't yet touched. That behavior doesn't give me confidence that it will always cover the entire area each time it runs. The RoboVac moved with ease on all of our surfaces. So, now, to the thing that really counts, its ability to clean. It did a pretty good job on the hardwood and tile floors, and it is almost worth keeping on its ability to clean the hardwood floors under our four beds, but not quite. The cleaning performance on the carpet and rugs was poor, and I had to use our upright to finish the job. Mind you that I had the "Max" setting on. Also, the roller brush required a lot of cleaning to pull the pet fur out (every day), which is a nasty job. (Somehow, our Eureka only needs the roller brush cleaned out once per month.) So, for those reasons, I will be returning the RoboVac. Obviously, YMMV. For homes without four furry critters, the RoboVac may perform very well.

R675:	This seems good so far after a month of usage. It replaces routine Swiffering for my 2700 sq ft house. I have mostly tile and wood floors. It gets caught on any clothes on the floor, as well as some wires. Other wires it powers over them. There is no way to instruct it to avoid certain areas, but I knew that when I bought it and the limitation is reflected in the price. For example, it always gets stuck if it tries to go behind my computer desk, which is annoying. If you are looking for a cheap robot vacuum, then this one is good. It got good reviews when I looked around. The higher end vacuums are too expensive considering their use-case, which is replacing a Swiffer. Update: after using it for a longer period of time it is frustrating how frequently I have to rescue it. It gets stuck on something nearly every run. Sometimes it runs out of batteries and stops. It would be better if it started heading back to the dock when the batteries get low.

It will just stop in the middle of a hardwood floor and beep because it thinks it is stuck. Not sure the durability of the more expensive brands, but don't think I should have to replace a robo vac every 12 months.

R684:	My second robotic vaccum. My first was a Neato about the same price ($10 difference). Positives (compared to the Neato): - Sound: compared to Neato, the Robovac is very quite. - lower profile: fit under more furniture - this one came with the side brushes compared to the Neato I had at that price point, Neato didn't have it. Negatives (Compared to Neato): - Can't set cleaning schedules: I can set a time for the vac to operate, but it will be on everyday which is pointless. - sucking power: a small caveat, but Neato was stronger (and more noisy). I don't have pets so I don't know how important that is. The Robovac was "adequate". - Big one (why this is going back): this is a dumb Robovac. It randomly moves around the room with no apparent plan or strategy until it pumps something and changes directions! Going back to its base for recharging is a messy and long ordeal. I one time tested it by asking it to go back to charging base literally right after it left the base, what should have been an L shap 5 second trip took the vac around the dining room and kitchen for over 25 min!!! I have never tried the Roomba but this one is not ready yet. I guess for one open space room (a basement with no sections to it) it might be ok.

R685:	Worked fairly well for about 6 months and now it won't work. It keeps beeping and according to the chart there is a roller issue. I have taken it off and cleaned everything. I have also order a new roll and rotating brushes, but it still wont work. I contacted Eufy and was given the instructions to clean it. I have not had it long enough to have deal with these issues. I would not purchase again or recommend to anyone to purchase.

R692:	Bought this to replace a 2nd generation Roomba that finally died. We use this in our finished basement. Cleans really well. We have one large rug and a Rottweiler. Cleans all hair in a single pass. My problem is the unit got "trapped" under our end table. I've attached a short video. The unit entered about 20 minutes into the cleaning cycle and couldn't get out. It eventually ran out of battery. I bought this unit to run automatically at night. This issue is a fatal flaw in my opinion. I'll need to look to see if there is an option to update software. UPDATE 12/2017 - I've had this unit for months. I have it set up in auto mode (start at same time every day). In the last few months there hasn't been one time this unit didn't get wedged/stuck trying to go under a piece of furniture where it clearly wouldn't fit. Added photos. Heard back from customer service: "he RoboVac detects with infrared ray and objects with very dark surface absorb the ray so the RoboVac will not be able to recognize them and will move forward and bump into the furniture and gets stuck." Based on this feedback I would not recommend getting this robot if you have dark furniture with a clearance gap under it. The vacuum initially bumps into the furniture, then lowers itself, then proceeds to get stuck under the edge. This occurs nearly every time the vacuum runs. I have it set up to run at a specific time each day. Once in about 2 weeks I'll find that it made it back to the charger successfully; all other days it's either stuck under the table behind my couch or our bar.

I have to follow it around my apartment with the remote to make sure it doesn't get stuck. It get's stuck in the same places every time, unable to figure out a solution and gives up quickly. I had several Roombas before that would occasionally get stuck, but more often than not they used multiple techniques to extricate themselves. Not so with the Eufy. It attempts the same ineffective patterns repeatedly due to lack of creativity in programming algorithm. I'm growing to HATE IT. I have no idea how it's got such good ratings here. Maybe primarily first-time robotic vacuum owners with nothing to compare it to. This machine and stupidity(lack of proper programimng) makes me so angry I want to break it. I hate it.

R697:	Product worked good initially, but in the past few months it has gotten increasingly loud and seems to get stuck more often during a cleaning cycle. I’ve cleaned and replaced all the parts but no improvement seen.

R698:	It's only been 2 days, but here is some initial feedback.... The product came quickly and in great shape. I charged it like the instructions listed and after it was ready, it went off to clean my floors. It doesn't really follow any pattern and does a little cleaning here and then there, but eventually it comes back and cleans pretty well. It has a very hard time on carpet and thank goodness we have tile and hardwood on most of the bottem floor, but I would NOT recommend this product for heavy carpet cleaning. The other thing that is a bit frustrating is it cannot find its way back home. I even pushed the button on the remote to go home....and after 45 minutes of going everywhere but home, I used the remote to direct it back to the station. I am still on the fence with this and unsure if buying the less expensive model was the right decision.

R699:	First let me say the seller is great. The product was packaged extremely well and arrived very quickly, but that's where the positive comments end. I read TONS of reviews before ordering this and I don't see how everyone is so thrilled with this thing. It has gotten caught (and stops running, flashes red and beeps constantly) EVERY TIME I USE IT. It gets caught on loop pile doorway rugs (very thin rugs), phone chargers, shoes, dog toys, area rugs, etc. Maybe if you have a round room, with NOTHING on the floor you might be able to use the automated/unattended cleaning mode. I would never try it. We run it at home while we are at home and we have to go save it 2-3 times EVERY TIME. I can't imagine waking up at 2AM to the alarm because it got caught on something. The problem with rugs is it that it is very inconsistent in being able to navigate them. These are very thin, extremely low pile rugs that are in the kitchen or at the entrance of a doorway. They loop pile rugs that are thinner than shown in the demo video. Half time time it will run up on the rug no problem, other times it flips the edge of the rug up as if you are rolling up up and then the thing is teetering on the rolled up rug and starts to sound the alarm. We also have two yellow labradors - so we have a few large dog toys. We try to keep the toys put away but heaven forbid they get one out - this thing is going to have a problem. It has also gotten stuck on a phone charger, lamp cord and a pair of shoes. For best results pretend you have company coming (run around and pick up EVERYTHING), turn it on and don't leave it alone. It DOES clean up very well, but that comes at the cost of rescuing it 2-3 times in the hour or so that it cleans the floors. By the third rescue I am so frustrated I just turn it off, empty it - and put it back on the charger.

R700:	This is my first self-running vacuum. I use this unit to clean my living room and kitchen floors on the first floor, which needs multiple cleanings a week to battle multiple cats. I find it does a good job cleaning my carpet and kitchen floor. It handles getting around most of my furniture and kitchen table chairs. There are two areas where it gets stuck about half the time, which is under my La-Z-Boy and between my couch and my movie storage tower shelf. The issues I have with it is that it does not map a room. If it does, it's doesn't do it well. If it gets stuck and you rescue it and restart it, it acts like it is cleaning the room for the first time again. So if it gets stuck after cleaning for 45 minutes, it will go back to the spots it has already cleaned. It doesn't appear to avoid walls or furniture. Rather, it just bumps into them and then rotates until it can move forward. You can program it to clean at a certain time of the day, but it cannot be programmed to run only on certain days. So you can turn the timer off for days you don't need it to clean or let it run every single day. I find it takes over an hour to clean the two rooms I allow it access to. So this unit is best used if you don't plan to access those rooms for a while or to run it while you are gone, which for me is a 50/50 risk on it getting stuck. Another issue is where it needs to be stored. The unit needs about three feet of clearance on both sides, which has forced me to place the base in a spot in my living room that is visible to everyone rather than in my kitchen under the table, out of the way. For the money it is a good value, but it lacks features the other units offer. **Update 11-23-2017** After sending a few example videos of issues to Eufy support, they suggested I try the new 11+. They offered to replace my existing one with the 11+ at no extra charge to see if the new one would solve some of the issues. I have tried it for a fews days and the one thing I noticed the 11+ has improved on is its ability to sense walls. It now stops short (most of the time) of running into the walls and will edge around them. It still gets stuck around my La-Z-Boy recliner, so I need to take the time to build blockades around it before using the vacuum. Also, it will still run over things like a pet's raised place-mat where the food bowls sit. So there are improvements, and the unit still does a GREAT job of cleaning the floors and carpet, but there is a ways to go to improve its ability to know it cannot get under certain furniture or to avoid more things sitting on the floor. **Update 12-12-2017** Unfortunately the 11+ busted a wheel trying to get under my recliner. It had pushed the blockade I had setup around it and repeatedly tried to bore into it. When it pushed the recliner back enough to get under it, the weight of the recliner pushed back down on the unit and trapped it. It must have tried to reverse out or something because when I got home it was nearly dead. When I pushed the start button it was flashing to try to get back to its base and I noticed a grinding noise as it limped home. I let it fully charge, cleaned it out, and tried again. It limped out and basically rolled in lazy long circles due to the one wheel not being fully functioning. Eufy support has been excellent at all times. I think they have an excellent way of trying to help customers. Unfortunately this product has issues with any floorspace that has things that need avoiding, even large furniture. Customer service refunded me the money and sent me a shipping label to return the product. This is a great-value product if you can ensure your area is RoboVac-safe. La-Z-Boy Recliners are apparently the worst nemesis for this unit when it comes to furniture.

R708:	I have a labrador retriever at home and purchase this vacuum in the hopes that it would cut down on the daily hair that we have to vacuum up with our upright vacuum. Unfortunately, I found that this only works if you have a.) hard surface floors and b.) if you don't have any mixed floor surfaces. On a hard surface floor such as wood, tile, or concrete, the RoboVac works fine, using its combination of sensors to roam around and find things to vacuum. It has a decent enough (not powerful) vacuum to pick up pet hair, dust, and small crumbs. However, when the RoboVac encounters mixed flooring, such as transitioning from a tile floor to an area rug, it becomes almost worthless, spewing dust and dirt in a trail all over the floor. The problem stems from the fact that the device can't handle being angled in any way. The dust collection bin is located near the rear of the unit and when the device is not totally flat, the dirt and dust simply spills out of the back. The wheel performance is also lacking; twice in the span of 5 minutes the RoboVac got stuck on an area rug about 1/2" thick because it couldn't transition from the rug back to the hard surface. These deficiencies made it painfully obvious that I wouldn't be able to use this because I'd basically come home and need to re-vacuum with my floor with the upright. If you decide to purchase this, hopefully you wont have the same problem I did, but I can say that it will be awhile before I purchase a robotic vacuum. They just aren't ready for primetime yet if you have a floor with a mix of hard surfaces, area rugs, and carpet.

R713:	UPDATE: I really want to recommend this product but I have now had three of them in less than a year and they have all stopped functioning as advertised within 2 months. The do a great job of cleaning but witihin 45-60 days everyone one of them started banging into ALL objects in front of them. I had just installed new baseboards in my home and now i have to do it again because these machines have crushed the corners. I simply do not understand all of the great reviews since this is clearly a defective product after 2 months!!! I think the reviews are completed prior to the 2 month period. I do want to commend their customer service department though, they have always been great to work with and very quick to respond. I am sending back the third machine for a full refund and going to purchase a different brand. I really want to give this thing 5 stars as the cleaning it does is amazing. Problem is longevity, it doesn't last as long as it should. Had to replace the first one i bought after a month. Second one is going on two months, keeping my fingers crossed it works fine.

R717:	This is an ok intro to robo vacs, however if I'd paid attention to the return window this would have gone back. It has decent suction, it picks up pet hair and dust from the wood and tile. It's not smart enough to avoid throw rugs and determinedly climbs those suckers and gets stuck. It cries for a few seconds in hopes of getting rescued then shuts down. So when I run it I have to go around and fold all the area rugs in half to prevent the poor thing from being stranded. Its pattern of vacuuming is also bizarre. It just bounces around and frequently cleans the same areas and misses many others. I should have just spent $10 on a dust mop, or $70 more on a roomba. Lesson learned :( Edit 9/8/17 Eufy has been outstanding in their customer service and offering to resolve the problem. If I'd paid attention to the return date, there wouldn't have been an issue, this vacuum just isn't for me. Updating my review from 1 star to 3 stars for great customer service.

R723:	This purchase is my first ever robotic vacuum cleaner. I bought it as part of a Black Friday deal (whopping 52% off) so I thought I would go ahead and give it a shot. The reason for this machine served two purposes: 1. - We have a dog that sheds without ceasing. It’s a daily challenge to try and maintain it. 2. – My daughter will soon be crawling, and we didn’t entertain the idea of her frequent exposure of all the hair on the floor. Setup was rather easy. Open it up and follow the brief instructions. Initial charge time was approx. 4-5 hours. While this little guy can in no way match the power of an upright vacuum cleaner, it did pretty well. When using auto mode it appears that its pathway is completely random. I do not believe that this machine “maps” your home. However, it does seem to get all the spots. It does has some difficulty navigating its way around cords (so much sure you organize or pick them up). With all that said, I like this robotic vacuum. I’ve been quite impressed with the functionality and the amount of dust/debris that it picks up. Every time I run it; it somehow finds more crud to suck up. The dog doesn’t seem to mind it. Excellent purchase if you want to conduct daily maintenance of your floors. I only gave it four stars because it keeps getting stuck in certain areas/scenarios and seems to do better on hardwood vs. carpet. Update: I did want to mention that customer service is very helpful. Several days after posting my review I was contacted by them to help me resolve several issues. I highly recommend this vacuum as they stand behind their product! Update #2: I've lowered this to three stars.After several weeks of ownership, the vacuum roller on the robot keeps getting stuck (it does a 4 beep error code). No matter how often I clean the brush it does this. I continually have to turn it back on. About 10 minutes later it does it again. Same carpet, low ply, no new obstacles. On carpet it appears that this happens when using the "max" mode. Not sure why.

R726:	After reading as many online reviews as I could find, I thought that I would try this brand of robotic vacuum. While this is not my first robot (I have an IRobot Braava mop that rocks), it is my first robotic vacuum. There is some good and some bad. It arrived in solid packaging with no damage good. It looks to be solidly built, it is quiet, and picks up a great deal of dirt.......when it works. The problem is that it frequently stops and give a signal that it is stuck. Even in the middle of the room, and especially frequently when traveling under the bed. I have what can be described as a low pile carpeting, and this device just does not have the ability to work on my carpet. I also have an area of commercial carpeting (hall runner) and it work just fine on that.

R729:	UPDATE: We loved this thing!! Just moved into our new house and found the box, hooked it up and the maiden voyage filled the dust bin. AFTER A MONTH OR SO, EUFY QUIT GOING HOME. We used the cord to charge and then after another month or so, it just quit. Really disappointed. Granddaughter sprinkled paper confetti stuff to feed it and it caught everything the first week. By the time we started having issues, we were settled into the house, it was just me and husband with fairly clear colors. End update. We've used it so far just downstairs on our tile floor, huge space, and it does travel under couches, under table navigating around chair legs, up onto the area rug, and cleans as you'd hope but may not really expect. My only disappointment is I haven't yet figured out the settings on the remote, but that also could be my granddaughter changing it to goof with me. If I found another great deal and had leftover in my budget, I'd get another to keep one on each floor.

R730:	We bought it seeing the wonderful reviews it has on the site. But seeing it work, there is some practical challenges involved. 1. It does not clean the room very methodically, it just randomly moves across the room picking up dust and also at times, missing areas where dust is accumulated. You have to keep managing it through remote to make sure it covers a certain area of the room. With similar effort you will be done with traditional vacuum cleaners in minutes 2. It does not reach corners or higher areas above the floor..a major disadvantage if you are switching from vacuum cleaners I have not used any other robot vacuum cleaners yet, but I given these practical challenges with these VCs I better move onto more traditional vacuum cleaners

R731:	*** Update*** 1 year of use. When the Eufy is working it's generally great. *When it's working.* In the course of a year I've had to have it replaced 5 times. The process is generally easy and customer service folks for Eufy are helpful. That being said I can't blame this on a "lemon" unit. It's the design and manufacturing of the product that's the problem. Some of the malfunctions were common knowledge to the customer service representatives. I was hoping to get a vacuum that would last me at least a few years for this price. Preferably at least 5. Instead I've passed the year mark of warranty from my original purchase and the company will not replace yet another malfunctioning Eufy. Number 6. I want to like this vacuum but with all the problems, replacements and now still not having a working vacuum it's just not worth the hassle. ***Update*** I've been looking at the iRobot versions for a bit but the price tag was hard to deal with. Eventually found this wonder. Comparing to a few friends that run different models of the iRobot this does just as well at a lot better price point. Would definitely recommend this to anyone and would buy another if it ever breaks. I have wood floors throughout my house with area rugs, two cats and a dog running around. I don't think the floor has ever been so consistently clean. No fur floating around all the time and no litter to walk on with bare feet. The amount I empty out of this thing every day is a bit disturbing but it's great coming home and finding all the rugs and floor clean.

R745:	17 months later, it's dead. Side brush, main brush error (2 or 4 beeps solid red). After being declined on any warranty relief I checked the mechanics of the 3. None have any problems. Even with the motors to spin without load, it's reporting the errors. A friend had gotten the RoboVac10, but I missed them. Then Eufy's first RoboVac suddenly went out of stock, so I was a little worried about purchasing this new model. Two minutes after it started I knew there wouldn't be a problem. It's first job was to clean up all the pine needles from setting up the tree, one pass pine needles gone. Hardwood to rugs, where not a problem. It's not very loud, you can easily watch TV while it works. It did very well untangling itself while under the entertainment center. It's short enough to go under almost all the furniture. Worth EVERY penny. If you don't mind it costing $15 a month.

R746:	I purchased this item March 21st. It started giving me issues mid-May, and it continued to do so. The charged base wouldn't charge the unit, and then it started to throw constant codes. It finally came to a point where the unit wouldn't run because it would throw a code. We tried all trouble shooting which we could with the manual at hand. My husband finally contacted Eufy at the beginning of June. Eufy agreed to have us send the defective unit back to them, and they would immediately send us a new one. They sent us a label, and we promptly returned our item. I finally contacted Eufy today (it's June 19th and we sent our item back first week of June) asking the status of our new unit. They had no record of a new one coming our way. Customer service even admitted that if we didn't contact them, they would have not sent us a replacement unit. Then, the agent processes the new unit for us and states it will be 3-5 business days at least. I asked for expedited shipping, and Eufy agreed. I just received tracking, and they shipped it FedEx GROUND! I will not see the new unit until Friday (wrote this review on a Monday). I hate to see how many more weeks it would have taken to receive the new unit if I didn't ask for expedited shipping. I AM NOT PLEASED. I WILL NO LONGER REFER OTHERS TO THIS PRODUCT. In the mean time, since Eufy was taking their merry old time, I bought a Roomba. I'll say the Roomba has better suction, and it does a better job at cleaning too. I can bet Roomba's customer service is MUCH better too. So, all in all, buy an Eufy...but if it fails after less than two months, don't count on their customer service actually following through without you advocating for yourself as a consumer.

R747:	After only 3 weeks of use I'm getting a fatal stuck roller brush error or stuck side brush error. When I first start it it moves a few inches and gives me a side brush error; push the power button, and it will switch to a main brush error. I've removed and cleaned the brushes very well, taking off the end cap of the main brush that pulls off and unscrewing the other cap but still the same 4 beep steady red light error. Even without the brush installed it immediately gives me a stuck roller brush error. Tried to contact customer support but due to a language barrier I was unable to explain the problem. Hopefully this one was a dud - but after reading the other 1 star reviews it looks like this is how they all eventually die. But, this one may have been more susceptible as even on its first use it gave me a stuck roller brush error on very low pile carpet. Loved everything about it while it worked, way better suction/cleaning than my roomba650. Luckily I'm in the return period and instead of having to go through a warranty process and receiving a refurb I can just exchange. Hopefully the next one is better, if not, I'm on to a neato.

R748:	While this ptoduct wasn't adequate for my needs per comments below. The customer service from Eufy was impeccable and i would have no misgivings trying another oc their product offerings. Purchased this a month and a half ago. I've been trying different layouts and blocked it off in certain areas to see if I can get better performance out of it. No luck. Probably going to try to return it if it isn't too late. Good: It is a robot with some suction and brushes. Kind of vacuums. Makes me feel like we are close to the 21st century portrayed in Back to the Future Part II. Bad: Horrible at navigating anything but small rectangular areas. I've got a pretty open dining room kitchen area, it's in the shape of a large L. The Eufy Robovac 11 cleans 80% of it well, 10% of it decent, and consistently misses 10% of the area. The 10% it misses is a 5'x10' foot print close by the home station, not sure if that has anything to do with it and a small space under a table. It really looks like there is NO logic to it's navigation algorithm. It will follow the wall for a minute then decide to shoot across the room, stop at the walk, 45 degree angle, then shoot off in some other random direction. You would think the algorithm would have it maybe navigate the exterior walls to set a boundary, then start 'filling in' the space contained within that boundary. Once it's footprint has passed over every inch without an obstacle it would have successfully robotic-ally vacuumed... I've tried the robovac in other rooms/sizes. It seems to do best in small rectangular areas with no obstacles and light dirt/debris. Any difficulty greater than that and you will start to see gaps in where it vacuumed. It stated it can vacuum on low pile carpeting. I have low pile carpeting in half my house, while it does pull some crud off the carpeting it does not do an adequate job. Still significant amounts of animal hair just laying on top of the surface (see below). While this unit is not rated for animal hair, there were multiple reviews and questions/answers regarding pet hair and the great job this unit does. I'm wondering what actual pets these people have, imaginary maybe? In hind sight I'm guessing these were fake reviews/questions/answers as I have pets and every 10 minutes have to stop the unit because either the brush is full of hair or the robot is clogged between the brush and dust bin. If you have pets and want a robot vacuum do NOT buy this unit. It is not pet compatible. Navigation sensors on board suck. It refuses to go under a bookshelf I have, the lowest shelf is 5-6" off the floor. But if I let it loose in my bedroom it consistently gets stuck under my foot board. I don't understand how it can see the book shelf as a threat/obstacle and yet doesn't see the foot board and when it gets stuck continues to try to drive under it. I bought this with the hopes of getting an adequately vacuumed house (I'm a single male so my standards really aren't that high) with minimal effort. Considering it can't adequately navigate my rooms, the horrible job it does on carpets, and the fact I have to baby it due to pet hair; It completely missed the mark. If you have a simple rectangular area with few obstacles and hard surfaces you should be ok. Any more complexity and you'll be disappointed.

R750:	At first I was thrilled, because it generally does work and it's SO NICE not to have to go around all your wood floors sweeping. BUT -- big but -- it will get caught up in a mid-high pile rug every time and every 3 or 4 minutes that now-predictable nauseating beep-beeping makes me go running to pick it up and re-place it elsewhere. I had been programming it to sweep while I was at work but came home every night to find it caught up on that rug. I'll have to blockade half my apartment now, which I didn't want to do (because the rig is right in the middle of expansive wood floors. Sort of defeats the purpose to have to set up rug barriers each and every time you want to sweep. So, not very convenient after all. But -- if you only have pure hardwood floors or a flat rug, it should do the job pretty nicely.

R753:	Updated Review for RoboVac 11s: While the 11S performs well, the replacement unit only lasted 8 months before it just would not turn on anymore. Review for RoboVac 11s: We were given the opportunity to try the RoboVac 11s. The 11s is a much better product. It does not get stuck on our carpets and has many improved features (such as a better brush guard and bigger wheels). The sensors also seem better and it seems to move slower so when it does bump into things it does not do so as hard as the 11. Original Review for RoboVac 11: The RoboVac 11 constantly get's stuck on everything. It will just stop in the middle of a "low-pile" carpet or in-between rooms and beep for a few minutes. Most of the time you can just hit the start button and it will continue to vacuum. That's not helpful when you set the vacuum to run while you're not home. I imagine if you had hard surface floor with zero obstacles the RoboVac would work fine. Additionally, the RoboVac will just bump right into everything. It is supposed to have sensors but instead just runs into chairs, tables, walls, etc. This proves difficult as the RoboVac will push a door open if it is not closed all the way or push things out of the way that you put up to block it in the kitchen so you have to use something heavier than you would expect.

R768:	What a great company to do business with. Upon posting my view, they immediately refunded my money and then asked me what I would like. I will absolutely shop with Eufy again. My vacuum was simply defective. Eufy made everything good and then some. Quite pleased. I bought the Eufy. Seemed more fragile than my other robotic vacuum. But, I liked its ratings on pet hair and stairs. What a mistake. It is more fragile- gets trapped by low thresholds, and then broke- only spinning in circles. I contacted the dealer- sent the video to an address outside of the Amazon Market place. No reply. I strongly commend against this machine.

R772:	More trouble than it's worth. Buy a Roomba, instead. The RoboVac 11 is a stupid Union vacuum, which will only work in ideal conditions and needs to take constant breaks for ridiculous reasons. My wife went cheap and bought the RoboVac 11 to use exclusively on hardwood floors about a year ago. It constantly gives error beeps, which I have to fix, because the RoboVac refuses to work until I do. Currently, we have a Side Brush Error message, which prevents it from starting. I took the RoboVac 11 apart and cleaned it yet again, but the Side Brush Error message won't go away. I tried electronics spray cleaner, WD-40, etc., but no dice. It's got a cheap, crappy little Chinese motor which isn't meant to be disassembled. Regardless, I'm tired of screwing around with this thing, so it's going into the garbage. We have two Roombas on other levels of the house, and they've been going strong for 3+ and 5+ years, respectively, with zero issues over their lifespans. We're buying another Roomba.

R773:	The vacuum is inexpensive, very quiet, and cleans well where it reaches, including hair from two dogs. We have a relatively house with a very complex floor arrangement (basically an octagon with small additions, rooms arranged in a "U" pattern). We found that we had to block the Eufy in individual rooms or it would only clean part of the house. After discussing this with customer service, which was very responsive, here is the reason. Eufy uses a random "Bounce" method to cover the floor space and has no memory of where it has been. So in our house it bounces around in the first room, may make it to another room or two, but then must go back to the station to recharge. But having no memory it then just starts random bouncing again. On rare occasions it gets caught bouncing back and forth between two objects. If you have a smaller house or apartment with a simple floor arrangement, that would work great. But in our house it seems like carrying it to specific rooms, letting it bounce around, carrying it back to the charger, putting it in a new room after it charges is the only way to get the floors fully clean. But to us that just defeats most of the purpose of using a robot. But if you are willing to do that, or have a small, simpler home then it is a very good, very quiet, inexpensive robot. Fortunately, during the time we have had the Eufy the price of the new Neato Connected dropped $200 so the Eufy almost paid for itself now that we will be replacing it.

R774:	6 month update: Our robovac has become vision challenged. the top might be scratch resistant but the lens in front of it, which covering the infrared sensors has become so scratched that the obstacle avoidance is mostly failing. Poor thing bounces off everything each morning and it's sad to watch. I tried to clean the lens, but it's not working, it's got micro cracks and has started to pull away from the bezel its glued into. My girlfriend and I talked about it last night and we are talking about "putting it down". I looked around online for a replacement lens but came up short. I can recommend a robovac in general but not this model in particular. They need to make the lens scratch resistant as well. After three months... It's been 3 months and we are more than pleased. We bought it as a Prime Day deal, a sort of gift for ourselves in our new house. We have lots of hard floors on one level and while moving it was clear it just will need a lot of sweeping. My gf is more picky about the cleanliness of the house and I could tell I was going to be expected to cater to her expectations of clean and my tolerances wouldn't much matter. So, I saw this as an opportunity to see if the robot was really up to the task. I got it because of the reviews and the price. The competitive brands were pricey. I love features and I'm seduced by anything that is "Alexa Ready", but this time I thought that I'm not really going to need to interface with my vacuum cleaner via Alexa and it wasn't a necessary feature. Most stuff is only 50/50 with the Alexa ecosystem anyway, so one less frustrating device was fine with me. Generally what I'm saying is that this was a cheaper brand and model and it lacked many of the latest bells and whistles of the Roomba's of the world, but I don't know that I need them at this point and we're super happy with the way it carries it out it's basic function/mission: wake up, eat dirt, when you are done, park yourself in your charger. It uses a remote control for basic programming, not a phone/tablet app, which does what you would expect and seems to work fine. If I needed more than simple scheduling and start/stop/steering I would really want an app. In 3 or 4 months, I've used the remote only 3 or 4 times. I scheduled it for early morning cleanings before most of the house wakes. My alarm wakes me before the robot and I hear "her" when she beeps awake at precisely the same time every morning. She has a definite sound, but it's not nearly close to your average push vac. In the quiet of the morning in a house still asleep, she is the prevailing sound. I can't figure out her pattern algorithm, she seemingly has no real plan to cover a room efficiently, she just turns away from obstructions at some angle and keeps going until she senses another barrier and repeats it like a drunk sailor making his way back to the bunks. We have steps and she has never tumbled down over them, even in the dark. We didn't have to put out any sort of electronic fence or strips to keep her contained, but we only use her on one level. Occasionally she manages to move one of the light floor rugs in front of the back door. One morning, early on, I caught her banging into everything like she was blind. Apparently she was. I guess her glasses were dirty. Cleaned the front of her optical sensors and she could see again and went back to her more agile self. Quite frequently, when a baseboard/wall is encountered, she will alternate between "walking" the wall or running a tight line along it and using her extra long "whisking" bristle antenna, cleans right to where the wall and floor meet. I never see a web or a crumb or dust along a baseboard. It's crazy. The biggest plus is that, despite her ADD style of cleaning, she gets the whole living room/kitchen/hallway clean.. every morning. She wakes at 6:15am and by around 8am she decides she is done and thinks about parking. I'm not sure how she decides this, but it's very likely based on time. There is no way she has any sort of indication that she has covered the entire floor, it's too damn random, but efficient or not, most days at 8am, she is parked and the floor is spotless. We've not had to sweep once in three months unless there is some spill that needs to cleaned up now. She can go a week or two before really needing emptied, but I've never waited to be alerted, I just do it as a routine every three or 4 days. She can fit under our couch and our table in the entry way, which would traditionally be an area that would be a dust bunny refuge and only occasionally cleaned. I had to move the couch the other day and had this natural expectation of a dusty horror only to see a mostly spotless floor (some corners were difficult around legs, etc). So far, this thing is awesome. When the machines rise up, we'll be in such denial they will wipe us out in 24 hours. I see me just stepping over the dutiful vacuum early in the AM, and she'll take me out before my first cup of coffee. If only she knew we appreciated her and she was very much a part of the family. #takemefirst

R775:	We bought this for every day cleanup of cat litter, hair, etc. It does the job for the most part! It doesn't have much of a system, just knocks all over the place haphazardly (missing spots occasionally). It does not avoid walls or furniture, just knocks into them (which is fine). It doesn't do a very good job on any type of rug/carpet, just bounces over. Battery life is good for the first 6 months and then it doesn't vacuum for very long. After 13 months of having it.. it stopped running and wouldn't charge. When I spoke to a rep, they're answer was "it's out of warranty, we can give you 15% off your next one." Sooo I wasn't very happy with this answer, as it shows they don't stand behind their product ($180/year for a vacuum?!). After being on hold for a while, a manager came on to tell me it needed a new battery; when it was replaced it's running again just fine... Moral of the story, buy a new battery!

R776:	It gets stuck constantly on things that aren't really obstacles, such as a wall next to a carpet, or chair legs. It is far less intelligent at moving around than the iLife vacuums. I bought both and FAR prefer the iLife robots. With this one I come home every day to find out that it has only cleaned for 5 minutes with nothing in the dustbin because it got stuck almost immediately. My iLife goes around the same area with ease and returns to its charging dock every day. But the iLife version I bought (v3) doesn't have a brush roll, which led me to try this. I'm disappointed. That said, when it is constantly monitored, it does vacuum well. Also, it's pretty tough because I kick it out of frustration almost daily, and it still works after 6 months. Get the iLife V7. Brilliant vacuum that has a brush roll and runs circles around this.

R777:	I loved this vacuum until mine broke. It did a great job cleaning and kept my floor (mix of carpet and tile) much cleaner than when I vacuumed manually. It did a great job of keeping up with a dog who sheds a lot. The dust canister is easy to empty and the filters are easy to clean/replace. Flaw 1: It has a tendency to jam itself under shelves and get stuck. I had to stick shims under the front of two shelving units I had because they were at just the right height for the vacuum to squeeze under them and then get stuck and unable to back itself out. Flaw 2: After 4 months of use one of the side bush motors broke, rendering it unusable. As soon as I turn it on it reports 'Side brush stuck' and no amount of cleaning/removing the brush seems to fix it. In fairness, if my Eufy was still under warranty they would have offered to send a replacement, however I won mine in a contest so it was not covered. However even with the warranty protection I would have hoped that the device would last longer before breaking and/or that it would have better ability to continue working when one part breaks. e.g. I'd be happy to keep using it with only one working side brush, but I don't have that option since it immediately stops and starts beeping every time I try to turn it on.

R778:	This is my first robo vacuum. I love how easy it is to set and will typically come home to a cleaner house. Although I followed the directions, my vacuum does not typically make it back to its home to charge. My kids think it’s a game to go find it. It also gets stuck on my stairs. I do think it does a pretty good job with the daily upkeep of hardwood floors and carpet. UPDATE: my rating had to be lowered. It no longer follows the set schedule and constantly cleans the same corner. I’m not sure what happened but I loved this product and had such high hopes. Very disappointed.

R779:	The first unit I received kept loosing the side brush and had a loud rattling noise on hard surfaces. Eufy customer service was great to work with and replaced the unit promptly. I've had the second unit now for a little over a month, and it's now making a rattling noise on hard surfaces and also has lost the side brush a few times. I have found that the noise is caused from the main brush wearing and no longer being secure. The way that their brushes are held in needs some work! The plastic wears down and doesn't hold. I have found that a small piece of electrical tape on the socketed end of the brush helps hold in place better. Also, my cat has fine hair and it gets stuck in the brush very easily and is hard to remove. I think Eufy has a great product, but really needs some improvement. I paid only $179. for it here on Amazon. Saw the new price of $269. now, and can tell you it does not warrant that price.

R780:	OK, but didn't replace our daily routine pet vacuuming like we hoped. We have large dog and got Eufy Robovac to help with daily pet hair. Very high quality, well made. Easy to assemble and activate. Seemed reasonable for price compared to Roomba. Simple instructions. Has good suction and strong motor and two sweeping brushes where Roomba has only one. It will handle thick pet hair easily and if you have a very simple house with little furniture and few built-ins and very low 1/4 inch rugs, it is fine. If you have a larger house with complex walls and built-ins and a lot of furniture with thicker carpets 1/2 inch or greater, it struggles a lot and gets stuck every 5 min. The problem is that when it gets stuck on its automatic cycle at 1am, it beeps and beeps for rescue? If it truly gets stuck under something and you don't get it before it stops beeping, it shuts down and won't reply to the remote? Found ours a day later wedged under bedside table after extensive search. So, my opinion is that it's not quite ready for prime time. Honestly the dimensions need to be about 10-20% bigger with larger wheels and ability to handle thicker carpets better.

R781:	After less than 3 months Eufy RoboVac 11 just spins in circles like a dog chasing its tail until it just decides to turn itself off. Now its essentially a $250 paper weight. When it was working it was a decent vacuum on par with my lower end 600 series roomba. For the money it was decent but based on what's happened in a short period of time I have to say that Eufy quality is lacking and support seems minimal. I had high hopes but because Chinese company with limited support it's hard to justify the $$$ for this robo vac. In the future I will be sticking with better known brands that can help service and troubleshoot better. I sent 2 emails with no response to Eufy.

R782:	On Jan 16, 2019 I purchased a Eufy Model 11C Robotic Vacuum from an Ebay seller. One reason for purchasing this product was it's 12 month warranty. Last week, the machine quit moving on carpet, climbing thresholds, etc. It also quit going around obstacles, instead just bumping them and sitting there. I called Eufy customer service April 8 to request warranty repair for my two month old machine. The CS rep immediately wanted the 'original order number', saying it was the number from when the machine was originally ordered from the factory. I explained where I bought the machine, but was told no number, no repair. The CS rep suggested I contact the seller and see if they had the 'original order number'. He informed me he had won the vacuum and had no idea where it was bought. I wrote customer service yesterday and explained to them what happened. I received an email back with the same story, except Eufy recommended I force either Ebay or the seller to issue a refund! That's right, they actually suggested I try to put my seller and/or Ebay on the spot for Eufy's junk product! I informed Eufy that I had no intention of making someone else pay for their defective product. I urge anyone who is looking at robot vacuums to look right on by the Eufy brand.

R783:	This works fairly well for what it is-- a knock-off Roomba. If you just need something to do a quick maintenance sweep, this will get the job done, but if you have a tough spot that needs heftier cleaning or something kind of stuck in your carpet, bring out the big guns cuz this little guy isn't cut out for it. I do like that I can plug this in and walk away (provided it doesn't get stuck) but in the end I wish I hadn't bought it and saved up for a Dyson or Shark stick vacuum instead

At first it ran about 1.5 hours and only got caught in the table legs a couple of times. It did have problems finding it’s way home. Now it only runs about 10 minutes before it stops and beeps 4 times (low battery). IF it actually runs more than a few minutes, it gets caught in a corner or table legs.

It is excellent at spreading dirt and dust around and if it gets up on our carpet, it dumps whatever is inside at that spot. It LOVES my dining room (least messy room of the house) and hardly leaves it unless I use the remote to send it into other areas of the house. I really wanted to like this product, especially since it was recommended by someone who had done a lot of research on all the robovacs. Will be returning.

R789:	When the vacuum worked it was amazing - quiet, long battery life, and a large dust bin. After 11 months one of the wheels stopped turning. I called customer service and they shipped another one to me ASAP, free of charge as it was less than a year old. Four months later the spinning suction brush stopped on the new one. I called customer service and they said that they couldn’t help me because I purchased my original vacuum more than a year prior and the new vacuum they had sent me wasn’t covered. So, here I am with two dead robot vacuums that are basically garbage. Will not purchase from this company again. Next time I’ll spend the extra money on a Roomba.
	S1:	When the vacuum worked it was amazing - quiet, long battery life, and a large dust bin.

R790:	This vacuum worked great for the first few months to keep my house clean. After 15 months it stopped working and would no longer pick anything up. Looks like the motor is broken, and of course it is out of warranty. Not going to buy a new one, and will probably switch to Roomba where the robot will actually last. Don't waste your money and buy something that won't break down.

R791:	I’m giving this 1 star because it was amazing when it worked but after only one year since purchase, the roller will no longer turn. I purchased a new roller just in case, but turns out it’s the roller mechanism inside the machine that can’t be repaired without taking the entire vacuum apart. Apparently it’s a common, and fatal, issue with this model. Very disappointed in Eufy for continuing to sell it up to a year ago!

R792:	The robo Vac is not a good choice. All of the sudden the vac stops and beeps as if it has faced an obstacle it cannot get around. No obstacle the Vac is in the middle of the floor. Sometimes it stops and beeps after just 10 seconds sometimes it vacuums for a minute then stops. It does start up again after turning it back on but the start and stop is horrible.

R795:	So we started out loving what my wife called Dusty as it did a great job keeping our wood floor clean, was actually amazed at how much it picked up running daily. Fast forward a month and I have to look around to find it and take it back to the base to charge, would just die in the middle of the room. Last night it did not even make it out of the room it charges in before it died. Sent an email to Anker support a few days ago but I’ve only received the automated response saying they’d get an agent with me as soon as possible. We’ll see what happens.

Far from it’s home base it finally gives up, emitting one final depressed beep and adding it’s corpse to the uncleaned room, where it awaits rescue from a sentient life form. At least I no longer live in fear of robots.

R806:	After less than six months, our RoboVac appears to have died an early death. It won't hold a charge so it won't move off the charging pad. Even before it's death, "Rosie" would frequently get stuck on nothing. I loved her for the first month or so but she quickly deteriorated to a beeping unmoving shadow of herself.

R809:	UPDATE I'm so bummed!!! I changed my 5 star to 1 star. We were totally loving our new robovac. And then things changed. We purchased two units to replace a previous Roomba and they initially worked great. However after about five or six weeks the first unit started having problems. About three weeks later our second unit started having the same problems. When the unit bangs into a wall, the sensors will redirect the unit for a new Direction. However, on both of our units, the sensors are getting stuck. And the unit will go in a circle. The only fix we have found is we have to physically knock the sensor unstuck. That typically entails finding wherever the stuck unit is, and very forcefully hitting the front of the unit until the number un sticks. This solution will work for some time, but invariably we will need to reset the unit again some time in the next 5 to 10 minutes. For me, this makes the unit's virtually useless. We bought them to have an unsupervised and automated cleaning of the floors. But when I am forced to find the stuck unit, and physically unstick the sensors every 5 to 10 minutes, it is a complete waste for us. So I guess this just reaffirms the idea between price and value. The Eufy is a great unit when it works and in my opinion preferable to the Roomba. But the quality is not there and it does not last. If this only happened to one of our units I would chalk it up to bad luck. But since both units are experiencing the exact same problem within a period of three weeks apart, it seems clear it's a quality issue. ORIGINAL POST AND REVIEW Wow! Totally love it! We had been loyal iRobot/Roomba users for years. Our Roomba did a pretty decent job for the 3 years we had it and thought things were pretty good. When our last Roomba (360) finally died, we decided to try something new and bought 2 of these. We have hard wood and ceramic tile floors. We also have three BIG dogs that have a dog door that they are in and out of all day and drag in tons of dirt. Our floors are a full time job to keep clean! We placed one upstairs and one on our main floor and programmed them to run once/day. The results have been awesome! Our floors have truly never been cleaner. We've only had them for about a week, so I can't report on the long term durability of the Eufy's, but will update my posting as we learn more. I listed several key characteristics that I thought would be helpful in making a decision. Overall Satisfaction Eufy ~ 5 Roomba ~ 3.5 Running Time Eufy ~ 5 Roomba ~ 5 Noise Level Eufy ~ 5 (super quiet!) Roomba ~ 2 (can't talk on phone it's so loud) Roomba seemed to bang into things ALOT and just didn't seem to cover the floors very well. The Eufy seems to have a much better sensor system and doesn't bang into things nearly as much, but also seems to have a better algorithm to cover the floors better. Efficiency Eufy ~ 5 Roomba ~ 3.5 Features Eufy ~ 5 Roomba ~ 3.5 Eufy comes with a remote control that makes it super easy to program, and also gives the ability to remotely start it, re-direct it to dirty spots, set "Max" cleaning, and more.
