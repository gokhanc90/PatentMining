robovac 11 all expected a out the last robot vacuum 
vacuum great feels little light brushes relatively hard a times vac the dust fluffies to home 
unless dust winds the underneath eufy dust a of getting kicked can moves 
remote true off hurt and often robot tends trouble going start area especially moving rooms out semi up up areas out going put set table have kitchen winds going for off area carpet repeatedly 
vac as prone getting stuck laundry given robot vacs sliding doors off tall easy edges dug  the of  bean of couch troubles over chair areas sadly as expected 
robovac handles edges questions 
cases approaches on turns out the 3 inches out 
cases little creative point find out back find of of seems choose going and way some  button off and edges repeatedly say the in and 2 cases got disappointed up out out 
rollers of brushes seem all little full care to filters find the up in quick in  kind carpet 
in empty dust bin the basic lint in every I time vac runs 
find the clever pattern could allowed hepa in up maybe out tripled area little be on so allowing suction great a run lasting consumer product or higher costing supplies costing everyone significantly a send up 
find the a life little easier takes a for 
acting gadgets thing may back 
think of improvements could made area function of sensor of in pattern enhance suction overall cleaning great

all loving new robovac 
things changed 
purchased 2 units back old roomba initially worked not 
the 5 a weeks the of started problems 
3 weeks and back of started problems 
of bangs in sensors redirect of new way 
the units sensors getting stuck 
of the me 
of up physically pick sensor unstuck 
typically entails finding wherever stuck of forcefully hit end of up un sticks 
solution to time constantly for reset of time by 5 10 minutes 
makes  about useless 
bought unsupervised automated cleaning floors 
forced up stuck of physically unstick sensors every 5 10 minutes in to us 
think reaffirms thought price time 
eufy not of and thought preferable roomba 
quality in
